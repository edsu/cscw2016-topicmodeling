This repository contains a [Jupyter notebook] for a PhD seminar in the
[UMD iSchool] to look at basic topic modeling concepts.

The repository includes extracted text and abstracts from [CSCW 2016] for the
topic modeling exercise. PDFs were downloaded and text/abstracts generated
with pdf2text.py. The abstracts were then pulled out with some regular
expressions that were tuned to the CSCW template.

Give it a try, by launching your own notebook in binder:
