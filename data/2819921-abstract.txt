As the world becomes more digitized and interconnected, iormation that was once considered to be private such as one’s health status is now being shared publicly. To understand this new phenomenon better, it is crucial to study what types of health information are being shared on social media and why, as well as by whom. In this paper, we study the traits of users who share their personal health and ﬁtness related informion on social media by analyzing ﬁtness status updates that MyFitnessPal users have shared via Twitter. We investigate how certain features like user proﬁle, ﬁtness activity, and ﬁess network in social media can potentially impact the lonerm engagement of ﬁtness app users. We also discuss implations of our ﬁndings to achieve a better retention of these users and to promote more sharing of their status updates.
