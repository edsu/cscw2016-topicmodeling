Patient-generated  data  is  increasingly  common  in  chronic 
disease  care  management.  Smartphone  applications  and 
wearable  sensors  help  patients  more  easily  collect  health 
information. However, current commercial tools often do not 
effectively  support  patients  and  providers  in  collaboration 
surrounding 
these  data.  This  paper  examines  patient 
expectations  and  current  collaboration  practices  around 
patient-generated data. We survey 211 patients, interview 18 
patients, and re-analyze a dataset of 21 provider interviews. 
We  find  that  collaboration  occurs  in  every  stage  of  self-
tracking  and  that  patients  and  providers  create  boundary 
negotiating  artifacts  to  support  the  collaboration.  Building 
upon current practices with patient-generated data, we use 
these  theories  of  patient  and  provider  collaboration  to 
analyze misunderstandings and privacy concerns as well as 
identify opportunities to better support these collaborations. 
We  reflect  on 
the  social  nature  of  patient-provider 
collaboration  to  suggest  future  development  of  the  stage-
based  model  of  personal  informatics  and  the  theory  of 
boundary negotiating artifacts.

To better address individual health concerns and coordinate 
long-term care planning, chronic disease care is moving from 
clinical care to home care [18] with increased focus on, use 
of,  and  even  reliance  on  patient-generated  data  [14].  The

prevalence  of 
self-tracking  applications 
(e.g., MyFitnessPal, WeightWatchers) and wearable sensing 
devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch, Microsoft Band) increases 
patient capacity for collecting health data and engaging with 
that data to support personal health and wellness goals.  
These  data  have  the  potential  to  complement  standard 
measures in the clinic with rich, everyday health behavior 
information.  However,  of 
the  one-third  of  current 
self-trackers who share data with providers, most reported 
dissatisfaction with provider engagement with the data [24].  
For  patients  with  irritable  bowel  syndrome  (IBS)  or 
overweight  and  obesity,  managing  these  conditions  and 
achieving  desired  health  outcomes  relies  upon  everyday 
lifestyle  choices  and  monitoring  to  identify  individual 
symptom triggers or weight loss barriers. Self-management 
programs and lifestyle counseling are clinically effective in 
these two populations [25,61], and both of these approaches 
encourage  self-tracking.  However, 
time  and 
resources  inhibit  providers  in  clinical  practice  from  fully 
engaging with and reviewing data collected by patients. As a 
result, patients are dissatisfied with feedback received from 
healthcare providers on data obtained from such diaries [28]. 
In addition, most commercially available self-tracking tools 
were not designed to support sharing or collaboration within 
or outside of the clinic visit, which makes the collaboration 
even more time-consuming and infeasible [10]. 
This paper examines how to support providers and patients 
in  their  engagement  with  patient  self-tracking  data  by 
answering the following questions: 
•(cid:1) How  do  self-tracking  tools  and  patient-generated  data

limited 

currently support patient-provider interaction? 

•(cid:1) How do these tools and data currently support patients

coordinating between self-care and care in the clinic? 

We explore patient goals for sharing self-tracking data with 
their providers in a survey of 211 patients and more in-depth 
follow-up  interviews  with  18  patients.  We  also  contrast 
patient views with provider perspectives in a re-analysis of 
21  healthcare  provider  interviews  [10].  We  examine  these 
combined  datasets  through  the  lenses  of  the  stage-based 
model of personal informatics [34] and boundary negotiating 
artifacts [32]. Specifically, we contribute an understanding of: 
•(cid:1) Patient  expectations  for  sharing  self-tracking  data  with

their healthcare providers;

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

•(cid:1) How current collaboration practices across self-tracking 
stages  support  or  fail  to  support  patient  and  provider 
expectations; and 

•(cid:1) How boundary negotiating artifacts are created and used 
to support interaction during the collaboration process, as 
well as privacy perceptions around these objects. 

Patients  describe  expectations 
that  collaboration  with 
patient-generated data will support diagnosis and treatment 
needs  as  well  as  affective  needs,  consistent  with  prior 
analysis  of  provider  goals  [10].  Toward  diagnosis  and 
treatment,  patients  expect  providers  to  have  a  complete 
picture of their daily life, to help make sense of the tracking 
data,  and  to  provide  a  personalized  and  actionable  plan. 
Toward  affective  needs,  patients 
seek  motivation, 
accountability,  recognition,  and  empathy.  We  find  that 
collaboration in all stages of self-tracking is influenced by 
whether tracking is patient-initiated or provider-initiated. We 
also find tracking tools and data are used as or transformed 
into  various  types  of  boundary  negotiating  artifacts  to 
support the collaboration. However, there is a lack of means 
to address privacy concerns that change across the evolving 
collaboration  context.  We  draw  upon  these  findings  to 
identify  design  opportunities  in  this  space  and  to  suggest 
future development of theories.

Prior  research  in  the  CSCW  and  CHI  communities  has 
examined  personal  informatics  tools  and  patient-provider 
interaction. This section reviews some of the most relevant 
literature and related theoretical models. 
(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:46)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:44)(cid:42)(cid:48)(cid:36)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:28)(cid:1)
An  increasing  number  of  systems  support  patient-provider 
collaboration  with  patient-generated  data.  Telemonitoring 
systems allow patients to collect their physiological data and 
allow providers to remotely monitor data and communicate 
with patients. Mamykina et al. conducted a series of studies 
showing  the  value  of  using  tracked  data  in  diabetes  care 
between patients and their care team and how patients used 
the  data  and  tools  to  make  sense  of  their  illness  and  care 
management  trajectories  [38,39].  Many  of  these  systems 
have demonstrated that features supporting collaboration can 
successfully  provide  necessary  contextual  information  for 
diagnosis  [55],  facilitate  communication  [2,47,52],  engage 
patients  in  the  shared  decision-making  process  [3],  and 
support long-term care management [31,50,56].  
On  the  other  hand,  personal  informatics  systems  allow 
individuals to collect and reflect on personal information. As 
these  systems  become  more  prevalent,  many  people  are 
tracking  their  health  data  without  provider  instruction  or 
involvement.  These  tools  are  designed  to  help  people 
independently correlate and reflect on lifestyle factors and 
health status [5,30] and to promote healthy behavior [12,37]. 
Knowing  the  value  of  everyday  self-tracking  data,  many 
self-trackers  have  begun  to  share  these  data  with  their 
healthcare  providers  [24].  However,  these  self-tracker

initiated  attempts  at  collaboration  often  fail  to  engage 
providers, which can lead to frustrating experiences [8,24].  
In our previous study [10], providers recognized the value 
and benefit of self-tracking data to help achieve five major 
diagnosis:  Providers  want 
goals: 
patient-generated  data  to  help  identify  barriers  for  weight 
management or triggers to IBS symptoms, which are difficult 
to diagnose without long-term observation. (2) Personalizing 
treatment: Similar to trigger identification, treatment choices 
are also subject to personal lifestyles and symptoms. Patient 
preferences  and  personal  choices  also  influence  behavior 
Increasing  motivation  and 
change 
accountability:  Self-tracking  can  be  difficult.  Providers 
found that proper instructions, followed by requesting and 
reviewing  the  data,  helps  patients  overcome  motivational 
barriers  and  be  accountable  for  their  health  issues.  (4) 
Learning 
use 
patient-generated data to understand unarticulated goals or 
values in order to build rapport. (5) Facilitating discussion 
and  managing  visits:  Having  patient-generated  data  helps 
providers to plan the agenda or manage conversations in a 
visit.  However,  providers  also  reported  barriers  in  current 
self-tracking  systems,  preventing  them  from  using  data  to 
their fullest capacity. In another recent study, primary care 
providers  also  reported  that  electronic  dietary  assessment 
tools  can  improve  patient  awareness  and  motivation  and 
increase efficiency in assessing diet [6].  
To further understand when and how collaboration between 
providers and patients around self-tracking data occurs and 
breaks down, it is important to understand how self-trackers 
collect  and  reflect  on  their  personal  information.  Li  et  al. 
proposed a stage-based model of personal informatics [34] 
that  describes  practices  and  barriers  when  self-trackers 
prepare,  collect,  integrate,  reflect,  and  act  around  their 
personal  information.  Bringing  self-tracking  to  the  clinic 
encourages collaborative reflection [40], but we believe that 
patient-provider  interaction  will  also  influence  tracking 
behavior  and  decisions  in  other  stages.  Other  extended 
personal informatics models also proposed reflection across 
stages:  By 
studying  quantified-selfer  practices  and 
experiences, Choe noted that reflections often occur during 
data collection [9]. Epstein et al. [16] focused on self-tracker 
decisions about starting, stopping, and resuming tracking and 
found  that  these  moments  often  include  opportunities  for 
reflection and advice. These models provide us a framework 
to  explore  patient-provider  collaboration  in  light  of  self-
tracking processes.

Collaboration  around  patient-generated  data 
requires 
knowledge and expertise from both patients and providers. 
Patients  are  the  experts  of  their  routine,  lifestyle,  and  
day-to-day  health  and  wellbeing  [4],  while  providers  can 
help  interpret  data  with  their  medical  expertise  and 
knowledge.  Technology  to  bridge  provider  and  patient 
expertise and experience is not new in the CSCW and CHI 

community, with many using the boundary object [e.g., 2] or 
boundary negotiating artifacts [e.g., 1] to describe extending 
health information technology to home care. The concept of 
boundary object was first proposed by Star and Griesemer 
[54]  to  coordinate  collaboration  work  between  various 
practices. To account for collaboration lacking standardized 
structure, Lee later proposed boundary negotiating artifacts: 
artifacts that can be used for practices not necessarily agreed 
upon by the people who use them, that can facilitate crossing 
and pushing boundaries, that can change with context, that 
can  be  incorporated  into  another  artifact,  and  that  can  be 
transformed into boundary objects [32]. We argue that the 
use of self-tracking data in patient-provider collaboration can 
be  seen  as  the  process  of  creating  and  using  boundary 
negotiating  artifacts  to  navigate  tensions  and  boundaries 
between the patient and provider spheres of expertise.

Moving  data  collected  daily  in  a  private  setting  into  the 
health care provider’s office raises questions about patient 
rights  to  control  what  data  is  shared  and  how  it  is  used. 
Personal  data  sharing  preferences  are  motivated  to  a  great 
extent by an individual’s relationship to the person receiving 
the  shared  information  [44,63].  While  explicit  regulations 
exist to protect patient privacy with rules about how medical 
data can be stored and shared, they have been interpreted to 
apply  to  data  created  and  kept  in  a  clinical  context;  in 
contrast, patient self-tracking data falls into a gray area [22]. 
We  can  better  understand  privacy  questions  surrounding 
shared self-tracking data as contextual integrity, or the idea 
that every space is governed by information-sharing norms, 
both implicit and explicit [43]. Previous work has explored 
the  socio-technical  dimensions  of  privacy  in  location 
disclosure  [13]  and  collaborative  awareness  systems  [48], 
while  numerous  context-aware  privacy  frameworks  have 
been proposed [e.g., 21,27,29]. Rawasizzadeh [51] has also 
advanced  a  secure  sharing  model  for  self-tracking  data  in 
social networking applications. However, these systems do 
not address the unique complexities of the healthcare context 
and patient-provider collaboration with self-tracking data.

Obesity  and  IBS  are  resource-intensive  chronic  illnesses 
affecting  a  large  proportion  of  the  US  population  and 
requiring lifelong monitoring and management. More than a 
third of the US adult population is obese, having a body mass 
index (BMI) of 30 or more [19], while IBS is estimated to 
affect  10-20%  [53].  Both  are  associated  with  high  total 
healthcare  costs.  Direct  and  indirect  healthcare  costs 
associated  with  obesity  in  the  US  were  estimated  at  $75 
billion in 2003 and projected to increase by $22 billion by 
2020 and $66 billion by 2030 [62]; direct and indirect costs 
of  IBS  in  the  US  have  been  estimated  at  $1.9  billion  and 
$19.2 billion, respectively [53]. 
Both illnesses are associated with multiple factors, numerous 
comorbidities,  and  lower  quality  of  life  [20,41].  Patients 
typically work with a multidisciplinary team of providers – 

SESSION: HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

including  primary  care  physicians,  gastroenterologists, 
dietitians, psychologists and/or psychiatrists – to identify and 
manage the causes and symptoms. Behavioral interventions 
and  self-management  are  integral  to  effective  treatment 
[25,61],  so  patients  may  be  asked  to  record  food  intake, 
exercise,  stress,  abdominal  pain,  heart  rate,  and  sleep 
patterns, among other indicators. Prior work has examined 
self-tracking  tools  in  various  domains  [e.g.,  myFitnessPal, 
58;  SleepCycle,  30],  but  their  use  in  patient-provider 
collaboration is not well understood.  
(cid:17)(cid:10)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:1)
To understand patient and provider collaboration and use of 
self-generated data in IBS and weight management, we used 
a combination of surveys and interviews with patients. We 
chose  to  focus  on  weight  management  and  IBS  patients 
because  these  two  conditions  are  frequently  affected  by 
lifestyle choices; IBS patients and providers commonly use 
lifestyle  diaries  to  identify  and  manage  individualized 
symptom  triggers,  while  self-monitoring  diaries  and  tools 
help  overweight/obese  patients  to  identify  barriers  to 
lifestyle  changes  and  maintenance.  Our  prior  research 
focused on provider expectations for using patient-generated 
data in care for IBS and weight management [10]. We draw 
on these results and re-analyzed the data collected for that 
study in light of this paper’s research questions.  
(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:27)(cid:13)(cid:29)(cid:3) We designed a patient survey to understand 
how patients currently track and share their tracked data with 
their healthcare providers and what they expect from this.  
We  recruited  survey  participants  by  pre-screening  the 
medical  records  of  a  large  academic  medical  system  for 
patients with BMI greater than 26 or suspected to have IBS. 
This medical system serves both urban and rural areas, with 
a diverse patient population. We sent 1841 email invitations 
and  received  237  responses  (13%  response  rate).  We 
compensated  each  participant  who  passed  the  screener 
questions and completed the survey with a $5 gift card.

The survey started with screener questions including gender, 
age, BMI and whether the participants have been diagnosed 
with IBS. If potential participants had a BMI of less than 26 
and had not been diagnosed with IBS, they were excluded 
from the survey. The main survey consisted of a combination 
of  open-  and  close-ended  questions  asking  patients  about 
their  experience  of  tracking  and  sharing  with  healthcare 
providers and their expectations and concerns while sharing. 
The survey took around 20-30 minutes to complete. Figure 1 
summarizes the survey question flow1. 
After excluding 26 responses that did not pass the screener 
survey, we had 211 valid responses. There were 147 (70%) 
females, 63 males, and 1 reported as other. Average age is 44 
(SD  =  11.8,  Median  =  45).  151  (72%)  participants  are 
overweight  (BMI  >=  26),  97  (45%)  have  been  diagnosed 
with IBS, and 23 (11%) have IBS-like symptoms but have 
never been officially diagnosed with IBS; this includes 66 
patients  who  are  overweight  and  have  IBS  or  IBS-like 
symptoms.  The  gender  ratio  and  age  distribution  are 
consistent with our samples in pre-screened medical records.  
There  were  157  (74%)  participants  who  are  currently 
tracking  or  have  previously  tracked  one  or  more  health 
indicators, 36 (17%) who have considered tracking but never 
tried  it,  and  18  (9%)  who  never  tried  tracking.  This 
ID  Gender  Age  Overweight or IBS?  Data they shared 

percentage  is  similar  to  a  recent  nationwide  survey  [17]. 
Among  participants  who  have  previously  tracked  or  are 
currently tracking, 117 (75%) have experience sharing the 
tracked data with a healthcare provider.  
To  analyze  the  open-ended  survey  responses,  the  research 
team first coded 20 responses using a priori codes related to 
our research questions, and then met to discuss consistencies 
and added or refined codes based on emergent themes. We 
iteratively  coded  all  responses  and  focused  on  patient 
expectations  and  experiences  of  sharing  tracked  data  with 
healthcare  providers.  The  research  team  also  created  an 
affinity  diagram  to  identify  any  emergent  themes.  We 
transformed survey responses related to experiences sharing 
self-tracked  data  with  health  providers  into  approximately 
350 affinity notes. We discussed the themes identified in the 
affinity diagram analysis in light of those identified in the 
coding process.

experience  sharing  their  tracking  data  with  healthcare 
providers,  overweight  patients  most  often  shared  their

nurses;  IBS  patients  most  often  shared  with  primary  care 
physicians,  gastroenterologists,  and  dietitians.  Across  all 
sharing experiences with providers, 39% of patients reported

SESSION: HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

(cid:26)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:1) (cid:20)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:1) (cid:10)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:10)(cid:8)(cid:23)(cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:1) (cid:21)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:26)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:1)
(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:1)
To understand collaboration using patient-generated data, it 
is  important  to  start  with  an  understanding  of  patient  and 
provider expectations for care within and outside of clinic 
visits, for their current practices of using patient-generated 
data,  and  for  future  uses  of  such  data.  Patients  described 
several  intertwined  expectations,  spanning  self-reflective, 
action-oriented  and  affective  aims,  in  tracking  health  data 
and  in  sharing  it  with  their  providers.  We analyzed survey 
responses regarding patient expectations and patient interviews. 
(cid:10)(cid:50)(cid:43)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:46)(cid:42)(cid:1)(cid:45)(cid:47)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:46)(cid:1)(cid:31)(cid:36)(cid:28)(cid:34)(cid:41)(cid:42)(cid:45)(cid:36)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:41)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:46)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:40)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:46)(cid:1)
(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:1) (cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:1) (cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:11)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:1) (cid:21)(cid:14)(cid:1) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:1) (cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:3)  Patients  shared 
with providers to give them a more complete picture of their 
daily life between visits and guide discussion during visits. 
“[I shared data with my provider to] assist my healthcare 
provider  with  health  trends  over  time  rather  than  the  few 
samples  gathered  during  infrequent  office  visits.”  -  P19.  
In this way, self-tracking data is an important part of bridging 
the clinical and home care contexts. Patients also used the 
data  to  supplement  their  narratives  during  office  visits, 
providing  empirical  support  for 
their  anecdotes  and 
discussion:  “Objective  data  about  issues  rather  than  just 
subjective verbal reporting.” - P20. 
(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:1) (cid:24)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:24)(cid:13)(cid:1) (cid:21)(cid:14)(cid:1) (cid:12)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:9)(cid:3)  Many  patients  reported  wanting 
provider input to help make sense of the data. “[It can] help 
highlight areas I believe I need assistance with looking for 
input  from  them  to  help.”  -  P7.  They  wanted  actionable 
insights  into  the  connections  between  their  symptoms  and 
their  behavior  or  medication:  “I  would  hope  they  could 
review it and make recommendations on ways to improve or 
help look for patterns that may cause my abdominal pains.” 
- P256. Some wanted help to see patterns and correlations 
among their multiple health issues or to use the data to look 
for  undiagnosed  problems:  “maybe  shed  some  light  into 
other health issues.” - P21. 
(cid:7)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:13)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:3) Patients also 
expected  providers  to  engage  with  the  data  and  provide  a 
personalized  treatment  plan.  “That  they  might  tell  me 
specifically  what  to  stop  eating  or  how  much  exercise  my 
specific  body  required.”  -  P22.  Patients  wanted  concrete 
feedback and suggestions about what they should change in 
accordance with the provider’s interpretation of the data and 
their personalized treatment plans; they wanted guidance on 
lifestyle  modifications  they  can  make  between  visits: 
“knowledge  of  what  things  I  can  change  in  my  daily 
routine/habits that will be of benefit to me being more active 
and healthy.” - P23.  
(cid:10)(cid:50)(cid:43)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:46)(cid:42)(cid:1)(cid:45)(cid:47)(cid:43)(cid:43)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:46)(cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:33)(cid:33)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:48)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:41)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:45)(cid:1)
Patients  also  detailed  affective  goals  in  sharing  their  data 
with  providers,  such  as  self-awareness,  accountability, 
seeking recognition, and a desire for emotional support.  

initiating  the  sharing,  38%  of  patients  reported  that  their 
providers initiated the sharing, and 23% of patients did not 
recall  who  suggested  the  sharing.  To  further  answer 
questions around collaboration during the tracking process, 
we  conducted  follow-up 
interviews  with  18  survey 
participants who had experience tracking and sharing their 
tracked  data  with  healthcare  providers  (Table  1).  We 
purposefully  sampled  potential  interviewees  to  strive  for 
variety of symptoms, self-tracking tools, as well as sharing 
data,  targets,  and  experiences.  We  compensated  each 
participant with a $25 gift card. 
We  conducted  an  hour-long  (range:  40-75  minutes)  
semi-structured phone interview with each participant. We 
developed  our  interview  protocol  to  focus  on  patient 
experience  of  tracking  and  sharing  tracked  data  with  their 
healthcare providers2. We asked participants to describe one 
or  more  experiences  when  they  reviewed  tracking  data  in 
clinic  visits  and  probed  with  details  about  how  they 
interacted  with  their  healthcare  provider  and  the  tracking 
data.  We  also  asked  questions  about  sharing  tracking  data 
outside the clinic visit and among medical team members. 
We audio-recorded and transcribed all interviews. We used 
the stage-based model of personal informatics systems  [34] 
to  analyze  the  data  to  help  us  understand  when  and  how 
collaboration occurs throughout the tracking process.  

(cid:4)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:1) (cid:14)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:1) (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:1) (cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:23)(cid:1) (cid:22)(cid:13)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:27)(cid:13)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:1)
We  reanalyzed  the  interviews  from  our  previous  study  of 
health provider goals and practices [10] to complement these 
interviews, focusing on patient experiences and perceptions 
of  the  collaboration  process.  The  dataset  included  21 
providers  who  work  with  people  managing  their  weight 
and/or  IBS  patients  in  four  different  health  organizations 
(two  academic  medical  systems,  one  health  maintenance 
organization,  and  one 
independent  provider).  These 
providers 
included  six  primary  care  providers,  five 
gastroenterologists, seven dietitians, one nurse practitioner, 
one behavioral psychologist, and one health navigator (who 
helps patients find resources to support their care plan). In 
these  hour-long 
their 
experiences,  expectations,  and  concerns  of  using  patient 
collected lifelog data in clinical care. 
As  we  will  discuss  later  in  this  paper,  Lee’s  model  of 
boundary negotiating artifacts [32] characterized much of the 
collaboration  activity  between  patients  and  providers.  To 
understand how tools and practices support these activities, 
we re-analyzed our patient survey and interviews, alongside 
our prior interviews with health providers [10], through the 
lens of boundary negotiating artifacts.

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:18)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:28)(cid:9)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:13)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:3)  As  described  in  personal  informatics 
literature, patients looked to their data for self-awareness of 
their  current  lifestyle  and  described  its  value  in  terms  of 
helping them see their habits [35]. “I clearly understand my 
current condition and behaviors, which I feel is important as 
I try to improve my diet and exercise habits,” - P4. 
(cid:8)(cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:25)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:27)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:3) Many patients 
could independently use tracking to regulate their progress 
towards  their  goals:  “I  struggle  with  weight.  I  have  to 
monitor to hold myself accountable.” - P7. Other patients felt 
they needed to share tracked data with their providers to feel 
accountable for adhering to treatment plans: “Failure to keep 
accurate data over an extended period of time might annoy 
or disappoint my doctor. I tend to look up to them.” - P24. 
tracking  data  with  providers  also  “provides 
Sharing 
motivation  and  positive  reinforcement.”  -  P25.  This  is 
important  for  setting  and  meeting  goals:  “it  would  solicit 
praise  when  I  met  each  individual  goal  and  thus  provide 
external motivation.” - P26. 
(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:20)(cid:16)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:26)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:3) Patients also 
wanted to use their data to get recognition for their efforts 
and to show their doctor they take their health plan seriously: 
“I just wanted them to know that I wasn't ignoring my weight 
and my fitness.” - P27. Patients may also desire emotional 
support or empathy from their providers when sharing their 
data: “to help them understand what I am going through” - 
P13.  They  also  used  their  health  data  as  evidence  of  a 
problem,  particularly  if  they  perceived  a  lack  of  empathy 
from their providers: “... he took my concerns more seriously 
when  he  saw  the  amount  of  time  I  was  sick  and  my 
symptoms.” - P28. 
(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:26)(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:1) (cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:1) (cid:6)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:1) (cid:20)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:1) (cid:8)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:10)(cid:1)

Understanding patient and provider expectations of sharing 
and  reviewing  tracking  data  provides  insights  into  how 
patients and providers want to collaborate. We next turn our 
into  how  providers  and  patients  currently 
attention 
collaborate, how tracking data practices are collaboratively 
set  up,  collected,  and  reflected  on,  and  whether  these 
collaborations  support  their  goals.  Using  the  stage-based 
personal informatics model by Li et al. [34], we analyzed the 
117  survey  responses  from  patients  who  had  experience 
sharing  data,  18  patient 
transcripts,  and 
reanalyzed dataset from 21 provider interviews to understand 
the  collaboration  process.  In  this  section,  we  first  present 
case  studies  of  four  patients  who  experienced  different 
interactions  with  their  providers  and  how  experiences  of 
patient-initiated  tracking  are  similar  to  or  different  from 
those  of  provider-initiated  tracking.  These  case  studies 
present scenarios representative of those reported across all 
participants.  We  then  discuss  how  these  experiences 
illustrate collaboration in each tracking stage of the personal 
informatics model [34].

Some  patients  started  tracking  and  sharing  on  their  own. 
However, their goals of sharing guided them throughout the 
tracking process and the interaction with their providers. 
Case Study 1: P4 had been in different weight loss programs 
for six years. During the past six years he had been tracking 
his weight, calorie intake, and physical activity on and off. 
He used FatSecret to record his calorie intake, a wristband to 
count his steps, and a scale and a spreadsheet to record his 
weight. He stopped tracking around two years ago because 
he felt his weight was under control. He started to feel the 
need to track again and bring in the data to his primary care 
doctor because he felt the weight he got from the clinic scale 
did not represent his everyday life and did not help his doctor 
to understand his problem. Therefore, he plotted data (weight 
and calorie intake) on a chart (Figure 2, middle) and brought 
it to the clinic. His doctor was impressed and would look at 
the data before assessing it against the weight measurement 
in the office and used the calorie data to talk about if there is 
anything P4 needed to change. Because P4 did not plot his 
step  count  in  the  chart,  he  would  normally  just  verbally 
summarize  the  average  activity  level  when  they  had  the 
conversation about physical activity. 
P4’s experience shows how his goals of sharing a complete 
picture  of  everyday  life  with  providers  motivated  him  to 
prepare and collect tracking data and how different ways of 
integration  influenced  his  interaction  with  providers  when 
reviewing tracking data. 
Case Study 2: P17 had been fighting with IBS symptoms, 
such  as  severe  abdominal  pain  and  chronic  diarrhea,  for 
almost a year. He had experience and learned about how to 
track food intake after his bariatric surgery around 10 years 
ago. He did not keep tracking himself until recently, after he 
started  to  have  IBS  symptoms.  He  used  MyFitnessPal  to 
track  his  food  intake,  medications,  and  symptoms  (using 
custom  entries).  He  shared 
the  data  with  his  pain 
management 
and 
gastroenterologist  because  he  wanted  to  prove  that  the 
medication did not help. All three doctors reviewed his data 
but  with  different 
levels  of  engagement.  His  pain 
management  doctor  went  through  his  data  thoroughly  and 
took  notes  in  the  medical  record.  She  also  printed  out  her 
notes  for  P17  to  reference  her  suggestion  about  vitamin 
supplements and instruction for pain medication. P17 put all 
the  notes  on  his  clipboard  at  home  as  a  reminder  and 
reference.  His  gastroenterologist  always  reviewed  the  data 
and the notes from other doctors and spent some time having 
a conversation with him about food intake, medication, and 
symptoms. His primary care doctor read the notes from other 
two doctors and asked him about the latest status, but did not 
directly read the data he brought. 
P17  had  a  different  goal  for  sharing  tracking  data  with 
providers:  providing  evidence  of  his  lack  of  response  to  a 
specific treatment. To achieve this goal, he shared data with 
multiple medical team members, and each interacted with the 

primary 

doctor, 

care 

doctor, 

data differently. These providers coordinated with each other 
using notes in the electronic medical record (EMR) system. 
 
(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:46)(cid:1) (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:43)(cid:32)(cid:44)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:30)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1) (cid:46)(cid:44)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:34)(cid:1) (cid:28)(cid:41)(cid:31)(cid:1) (cid:45)(cid:35)(cid:28)(cid:44)(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:34)(cid:1) (cid:29)(cid:51)(cid:1) (cid:43)(cid:44)(cid:42)(cid:48)(cid:36)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:44)(cid:1)
(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:46)(cid:44)(cid:47)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)
Some  patients  started  tracking  because  their  providers 
instructed  them  to  do  so.  These  providers  often  provided 
detailed  instructions  on  how  and  what  to  track,  suggested 
their  preferred  tools,  or  communicated  their  goals  for 
reviewing  tracking  data.  The  communication  influenced 
patient tracking behavior and interaction with providers. 
Case Study 3: P6 was in a weight loss program. She had 
been working with one dietitian, Katy (pseudonym), for two 
years. She visited Katy every six to eight weeks. Katy taught 
her to keep a record of her weight, beverages, and food intake 
one day in a week. Katy introduced MyFitnessPal to her and 
explained how to use the app in detail. Katy also answered 
her questions about using the app during each clinic visit.  
In the clinic, Katy would use P6’s phone to login into her 
MyFitnessPal and review the data in detail. Katy would also 
ask for clarification about the data. Katy then took notes from 
the  data  and  plotted  the  data  into  her  spreadsheet  on  her 
computer.  Then  Katy  would  show  P6  the  trend  and  the 
pattern of her data and explain those to her. If Katy thought 
they needed to change the diet plan or calorie goal, she would 
just change that directly on P6’s phone so she could follow 
the plan at home. 
P6’s  dietitian  worked  with  her  in  configuring  the  tools, 
answering questions while she collected data, showing her 
how  to  review  data,  reading  through  data,  and  directly 
inputting  suggestions  into  her  tools.  These  experiences 
provided  the  patient  with  knowledge  about  the  tool  and  her 
health status, managed her expectations about reviewing data 
with the dietitian, and helped her follow advice outside of visits. 
Case  Study  4:  P2  had  suffered  from  excessive  bowel 
movement, constant bloating, and acid reflux for over a year. 
He worked with one naturopathic doctor, Jeff (pseudonym), 
to start an elimination diet and keep track of his food intake. 
In the first session, Jeff gave P2 a paper for him to record the 
data. However, P2 felt it was too troublesome to keep records 
on paper and he gave up on it in one day. He started to try 
different  tools  including  Excel  and  various  apps  in  the 
market. He gave up using most of them in less than three days 
until  he  found  mySymptoms.  He  used  the  app  to  keep 
records.  The  analysis  function  allowed  him  to  reflect  on 
possible  correlations  between  food  and  his  symptoms.  He 
printed  out  one  report  using  the  standardized  feature  and 
brought  it  to  the  follow-up  visit  in  three  weeks.  P2  went 
through his diet record with Jeff. Jeff then gave him some 
high-level comments to ensure he had at least three-to-four 
day rotations on foods and his diet was balanced. He went 
back  to  see  Jeff  after  another  three  weeks  with  his  data. 
However,  Jeff  did  not  look  through  his  data  this  time  and 
asked him to describe his diet verbally. After this experience, 
P2 stopped bringing in his data to Jeff.

SESSION: HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

Sometimes, even when tracking was instructed by providers, 
patients  like  P2  still  make  their  own  decisions  about  tool 
options  and  what  specifically  to  track.  However,  P2’s 
experiences showed that his providers had a different goal 
for  reviewing  data  (empowering  P2  to  understand  his  diet 
plan) than from what he had (monitoring treatment plans and 
effects). This conflict resulted in termination of collaborative 
review before P2 was ready.

The experiences presented in the case studies depict different 
types  of  patient-provider  interactions  with  shared  patient-
collected  data  in  current  clinical  practice.  To  further 
understand  when  and  how  these  collaborations  take  place, 
we present the results of our analysis based on the five-stage 
model  for  personal  informatics  from  Li  et  al.  [34]: 
preparation,  collection,  integration,  reflection,  and  action. 
We  describe  how  sharing  occurs  between  patients  and 
providers  on  self-tracked  data  and  how  sharing  influences 
tracking  behavior  in  all  stages.  To  illustrate  a  range  of 
experiences  in  patient-provider  collaboration,  we  describe 
representative  as  well  as  suggestive  examples  from 
interviews and surveys.(cid:1)
(cid:5)(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:16)(cid:7)(cid:17)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:1)
People plan for what and how they want to track in this stage. 
However,  knowing  what  and  how  to  track  are  common 
barriers for people to start tracking. Epstein et al. [16] further 
divided  the  preparation  stage  into  deciding  to  track  and 
selecting tools. 
For  provider-initiated  tracking  and  sharing,  patients  were 
normally given adequate motivations to track: monitoring for 
a  specific  treatment  (e.g.,  elimination  diet  for  P17)  or  for 
long-term  performance  (e.g.,  weight  loss  performance  for 
P6).  Patients  also  reported  being  asked  to  track  their  food 
intake  to  get  approval  for  bariatric  surgery  (P9,  P17,  P29, 
P30,  P31,  P32,  P33,  P34,  P35,  P36,  P37,  P38)  or  gastric 
pacemaker  implantation  (P14,  P39).  For  patients  being 
considered for bariatric surgery, they were asked to do a trial 
of the recommended post-operative dietary guidelines and to 
track  their  diet  for  a  defined  time  period  for  compliance. 
Greater weight loss, and maintenance of this weight loss, is 
more promising for patients able to adhere to this diet post-
operatively. For gastric pacemaker implantation in patients 
with gastroparesis (slow emptying of the stomach), providers 
reported wanting to make sure that patients have “maximized 
medical  therapy,”  which  includes  dietary  management. 
These patients are therefore also asked to track their diet for 
compliance prior to being considered for a gastric pacemaker. 
Providers sometimes recommended tracking tools to patients 
for  clinical  diagnosis  and  management.  These  included 
traditional  paper-based  diaries  (e.g.,  bariatric  surgery 
handbook,  P8),  a  specific  application  (e.g.,  MyFitnessPal, 
P6), and, for one participant, a list of popular applications 
(P3).  However,  patients  do  not  always  follow  those 
recommendations. Some patients have tools with which they 
are  already  familiar  (P3,  P9)  or  follow  suggestions  from

friends or family (P40, P41). They may also have specific 
needs that the provider-recommended tool does not fulfill. 
For example, P2 hoped to self-identify correlations between 
his  food  intake,  medication,  and  symptoms.  However,  he 
found it difficult to use the paper diary provided by his doctor 
and therefore used mySymptoms app instead. Tools selected 
by  patients,  however,  do  not  always  support  collaborative 
review in the clinic. Many providers still preferred a paper 
diary for better interaction affordance [10]. This sometimes 
created a tension for later collaboration in the reflection stage. 
For patients who initiated tracking on their own, some chose 
specific  items  to  track  with  eventual  sharing  in  mind.  For 
example,  P4  started  to  track  his  weight  and  calorie  intake 
again because he wanted to show his doctor his day-by-day 
effort toward weight loss. He did not feel that weighing in at 
the clinic every six weeks was enough to represent “what’s 
going on in his life”. He also chose a tool that allowed him 
to later integrate his data to support collaborative reflection 
in the later stage. 
(cid:3)(cid:15)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)
In  the  collection  stage,  people  start  to  record  their  own 
information.  This  almost  always  only  involved  patients 
themselves.  However,  some  patients  said  that  having  the 
ability to send questions to providers through a patient portal 
or email helped them to overcome barriers around tool use 
and accuracy. For example, P10 described sending how she 
was  feeling  and  questions  about  perplexing  data  to  her 
provider.  Having  the  expectation  of  provider  review  also 
increased  patient  accountability  and  motivation.  For 
example, P5 mentioned in the interview “knowing someone 
will look over the data forces me to be more aware of what I 
eat and what I write down.” P8 said he kept a more detailed 
record because he knew his dietitian and nurse cared about 
these data and would read through the data carefully. 
(cid:4)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:11)(cid:17)(cid:7)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:1)
People integrate their tracking data to support reflection in 
the  later  stage  of  the  personal  informatics  model.  Some 
patients  did  not  need  to  spend  much  effort  on  integration 
because  the  apps  they  used  supported  this  step.  P2  used 

mySymptoms,  which  provides  correlation  features,  and 
others used tools that include an integrated dashboard (e.g., 
MyFitnessPal, P6; LoseIt, P9). Some patients created their 
own integration by making their own report (e.g., P4 [Figure 
2, middle], P8 [Figure 2, right]). One patient selected specific 
records  to  print  for  providers  (P5).  Others  highlighted 
particular  entries  in  their  paper  records  to  help  focus  the 
conversation (e.g., P1, P10 [Figure 2, left]). Other patients 
read  through  their  notes  and  integrated  data  in  their  head 
before the clinic visit, where they provided a verbal summary 
to their health providers (e.g., P15, P16, P18). 
To support collaborative reflection, patients need to integrate 
data  based  on  both  provider  and  patient  goals.  However, 
patients  and  providers  did  not  always  understand  each 
other’s  goal  well.  For  example,  providers  sometimes 
encouraged patients to track to be aware of their own health 
issues.  Thus,  they  did  not  plan  to  thoroughly  review  the 
information and just had the goal of providing affirmation 
and  emotional  support.  Patients,  on  the  other  hand,  might 
expect  providers  to  help  make  sense  of  their  data  and 
therefore bring pages of data to the visit. Some patients felt 
frustrated afterwards when this goal was not obtained (e.g., 
P2, P10, P42). It was also difficult for patients who initiated 
tracking  and  sharing  to  anticipate  their  provider’s  goal 
beforehand,  or  providers  might  not  have  specific  goals 
before seeing patient-tracked data. 
(cid:6)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:1)
In  the  reflection  stage,  people  review  their  collected  and 
integrated  dataset  to  make  sense  of  it.  Patients  in  our 
interviews  reported  spending  an  average  of  five  minutes 
(approximately 25% of the clinic visit) reviewing their data 
with their primary care physicians or gastroenterologists and 
10-20 minutes (25% of the clinic visit) with their dietitians, 
consistent with our previous study with providers [10]. 
Patients also often reviewed the data with multiple healthcare 
providers.  Different  providers  might  have  had  different 
review goals and therefore different approaches to reviewing 
patient-generated  data.  P17  described  having  a  thorough 
review  with  one  doctor  and  a  brief  verbal  review  with 

777

transformed 

another. Similarly, P8’s dietitian spent 20 minutes focusing 
on reviewing his day-to-day food intake while his bariatric 
nurse was more interested in his overall health. She therefore 
distributed her review time across a food diary, an exercise 
log, and other lab test results. 
The  reflection  stage  may  also  lead  to  another  preparation 
stage  where  providers  and  patients  decide  on  a  change  in 
treatment  or  a  need  for  new  treatment  in  response  to 
monitoring. In this case, providers may suggest that patients 
track different items to help with better treatment. 
(cid:2)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:1)
People decide what actions to take based on findings from 
reflection  on  the  tracking  record.  Because  chronic  disease 
such as overweight/obesity and IBS require long-term care, 
patients might start another care cycle [7] at this stage. Some 
patients used notes they took (e.g., P16, P18) or were printed 
by  providers  (e.g.,  P11,  P17)  to  assist  them  to  follow  the 
treatment plan or track new data points.  
(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:1) (cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:6)(cid:1) (cid:6)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:1) (cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:22)(cid:1) (cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:1) (cid:23)(cid:13)(cid:10)(cid:1)
(cid:8)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:16)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:1)
Based  on  our  findings  of  how  providers  and  patients 
collaborate, we started to analyze how tracking data and tools 
support  collaboration  in  these  stages.  As  patients  and 
providers  went  through  different  collaboration  stages, 
patient-generated  data  was 
into  different 
physical or conceptual forms to support collaboration. We 
adopted the framework of boundary negotiating artifacts by 
Lee  [32] 
the  survey  responses,  patient 
interviews, and provider interviews.  
Lee defined five types of boundary negotiating artifacts that 
facilitate  information  transmission  and  collaboration:  self-
explanation  artifacts, 
inclusion  artifacts,  compilation 
artifacts,  structuring  artifacts,  and  borrowed  artifacts.  We 
found different privacy needs and perceptions, as framed by 
the concept of contextual integrity, evolved while using and 
sharing  these  data  over  time.  Upholding  privacy  as 
contextual integrity [43] requires that the information shared 
be appropriate to the context; it also requires the information 
be distributed in a way that respects the norms of the context. 
As Nissenbaum [43] notes, the norms of appropriateness and 
distribution are complex in the healthcare domain. Looking 
at patient self-tracking data as boundary negotiating artifacts 
allows a clearer view of privacy questions. In patient-provider 
interactions with self-tracking data, discretion over what type 
and  amount  of  information  is  shared  is  fluid;  the  provider 
may request data for diagnostic and treatment purposes, or 
the patient may offer her own data in order to optimize her 
care.  As  patient-provider  collaboration  recasts  self-tracking 
data as different types of boundary negotiating artifacts, patient 
privacy expectations and needs change accordingly. 
In the following section, we present a summary of the use of 
four  types  of  boundary  negotiating  artifacts  in  patient-
provider collaboration around self-tracked data. Appendix 1 
also summarizes these results with examples.

Self-explanation artifacts are those created for personal use. 
The  practice  around  the  creation  of  this  type  of  artifact  is 
normally  based  on  personal  expertise  and  experience. 
Examples of self-explanation artifacts from Lee [32] include 
personal sketches and notes that help to record, organize, and 
analyze personal ideas. Patient-generated data can function 
as  self-explanation  artifacts,  particularly  when  patients 
initiate self-tracking themselves. Patients are the experts of 
their own life routines, and after years of managing weight 
and IBS, they also become experts of their personal health 
issues.  They  create  tracking  data  that  manifest  these 
experiences and knowledge about themselves. These data do 
not  necessarily  come  with  a  standardized  format  and 
sometimes  are  highly  personalized  based  on  individual 
health issues and their definition of meaningful, even when 
patients use the same tools. For example, P10 chose to record 
using  paper  notes  because  she  was  undergoing  complex 
symptoms and following a diet plan, which made it hard for 
her to use a general tracking tool.  
When patients create the tracking record, they start with a set 
of  privacy  expectations  −  while  their  data  are  still  a  self-
explanation boundary artifact. In the case of patient-initiated 
tracking, initially they might not expect to share the data with 
others,  even  their  health  care  providers.  For  provider-
initiated  tracking,  patients  expect  that  someone  will  read 
their data and this might change their behavior around the 
creation  of  this  artifact.  Alternatively,  patients  might  not 
want to be judged for certain behavior so they either change 
that behavior or choose not to record it. For example, P3’s 
worst  sharing  experience  was  feeling  blamed  for  having  a 
beer after work. He gave up the habit of drinking because he 
was  tired  of  explaining,  but  he  still  considered  that  an 
unpleasant sharing experience.  
Patients who initiate tracking themselves might also gather 
too  much  or  irrelevant  data.  Or,  they  might  collect  data 
relevant for their personal use but irrelevant in the sharing. If 
the self-explanation artifact is later incorporated in a provider 
interaction,  patients  risk  exposing  information  that  is  not 
needed in the context at hand. Viewed through the lens of 
contextual integrity, a patient collects data he or she deems 
appropriate for the context in which he or she is tracking; 
incorporating these data in a provider visit may reveal self-
explanation  data  that  is  out  of  the  healthcare  context, 
particularly  if  they  initiated  the  self-tracking  process.  It  is 
only  after  considering  sharing  or  interacting  with  their 
providers  that  these  patients  can  select  the  most  relevant 
information  to  gather  and  share.  Furthermore,  for  patients 
whose providers requested they start tracking, patients may 
not be fully aware of the privacy implications of self-tracking 
or the features of the tools they are asked to use, affecting 
their ability to provide informed consent to track and for their 
provider to access sensitive information.

Inclusion artifacts are created from self-explanation artifacts 
or other artifacts through a negotiation process to facilitate 
the  discussion  of  new  ideas.  The  inclusion  process  might 
involve presenting, accepting, and rejecting what comprises 
the  inclusion  artifacts.  Patients  create  inclusion  artifacts 
when  they  bring  their  data  to  the  clinic  visit.  Verbal 
summaries play an important role in presenting their tracking 
data because they help explain it with personal narrative. In 
comparison to measurements in the clinic, patients believe 
the data provide a more accurate, day-to-day record of their 
health  and  wellness  (e.g.,  weight  and  blood  pressure), 
relationships 
symptoms  
(e.g., certain foods and abdominal pain), and proof of their 
effort towards certain health outcomes (e.g., physical activity 
and weight loss performance). They also expect that the data 
will help their health care providers better understand their 
daily life and create more personalized treatment plans.  
For data that transitions from a self-explanation artifact to an 
inclusion  artifact,  contextual  integrity  highlights  questions 
surrounding distribution of the data. Here there is a tension 
between the patient’s right to control the disclosure of their 
own  data  and  the  provider’s  authority  to  request  such 
information. Many patients believe being honest and open to 
their  provider  is  necessary  and  rely  on  providers  to  direct 
them about what to share or what not to share. For example, 
when asked why they did not share a particular type of data, 
some patients said that it was because their providers “did 
not ask for it” - P43.   
Distributing confidential information via narrative is a norm 
in  the  healthcare  context.  Patients  have  traditionally  done 
this by verbally filtering and summarizing their experiences, 
leaving what they reveal at their discretion, even when asked 
explicitly  for  information  by  their  provider.  Self-tracking 
data,  particularly  when  it  is  difficult  to  edit  or  filter,  can 
inhibit patient abilities to distribute their health information 
at  their  own  discretion.  For  example,  P5  only  trusted  one 
dietitian, with whom she had worked for six years, to review 
her data. She thought her food and symptom diary were very 
personal and she did not think she had the same relationship 
with other providers; therefore, she only verbally described 
the data to them. 
(cid:8)(cid:42)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:36)(cid:39)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:44)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:33)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:45)(cid:1)
Compilation  artifacts  are  used  to  facilitate  sharing  and 
coordinating  information  among  parties.  The  process  of 
creating  compilation  artifacts  might  include  collecting 
information 
from  different  sources,  organizing  and 
discussing in a shareable state, and presenting and explaining 
the information to align the goals of all parties involved. This 
compilation process might also involve practices to resolve 
conflict and confusion. By reviewing patient-generated data, 
test results, disease history, and other clinical information, 
providers  created  a  compilation  artifact.  These  different 
sources  of  inclusion  information  sometimes  conflict  with 
each other or are unclear for medical decision-making, and 

therefore require that providers and patients collaboratively 
interpret  the  data.  This  process  also  sometimes  involves 
multiple medical team members. The compilation object is 
commonly presented as a clinical note in the medical record, 
accessible  by  all  healthcare  providers  caring  for  the  same 
patient (e.g., P14, P17) or as printed patient instructions given 
to patients following a clinical encounter (e.g., P2, P4, P10).  
Uncertainties  around  appropriateness  and  distribution  are 
further  compounded  when  self-tracking  data  becomes  a 
compilation artifact. Once shared in a clinic visit, the data 
may be re-shared or visible to other parties [e.g., 23,49,57]. 
Although  providers  and  patients  work  together  to  create 
compilation  objects,  patients  might  not  feel  comfortable 
sharing the same information with every provider. However, 
with  EMRs,  self-tracking  data  can  be  shared  among 
collaborating  doctors  without  patient  knowledge,  or  even 
many years later with providers who are not working with 
the patients, violating norms of appropriateness. For example, 
mental health data discussed in a primary care provider visit 
and captured in an EMR during that visit may later be visible 
to a gastroenterologist, for whom the only appropriate self-
tracking data to review may be food intake and abdominal 
symptoms. This can disturb the patient’s contextual integrity 
by overriding distribution norms (e.g., moving data collected 
in one context to many other healthcare spheres without their 
knowledge or explicit permission).  
These  privacy  questions  are  compounded  by  regulatory 
uncertainty  about  self-tracking  data.  Under  the  Health 
Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA) 
guidelines, an individual’s confidential information such as 
that contained in self-tracking data should only be accessed 
by  the  individual  or  their  provider.  While  personal  health 
information (PHI) found in EMRs and other clinical datasets 
are protected by HIPAA, the regulations and best practices 
surrounding  self-tracking  data  brought  into  the  clinical 
environment  are  less  clear  [22].  The  Food  and  Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  has  put  forth  guidelines  on  mobile 
apps being used like medical devices, but has said it will not 
regulate them [60]. Self-tracking data may not be considered 
PHI under current regulation  [22], and patients in our study 
were  confused  about  whether  these  data  are  protected  by 
HIPPA  (P44,  P45). 
  More  clarity  is  needed  around  
self-tracked data transfer and storage in a clinical setting. If 
self-tracked data are requested by the provider, these issues 
may become even murkier.

Structuring  artifacts  are  created  to  coordinate  information 
use  and  to  direct  and  coordinate  the  activity  of  parties 
involved  in  the  collaboration.  It  might  also  be  used  to 
structure  the  final  product  but  depending  on  the  view  of 
participating  parties,  it  might  be  used  differently.  After 
negotiating and compiling health information, providers and 
patients  reached  decisions  that  could  then  generate  a 
structuring  artifact  or  a  new  inclusion  artifact.  This  often 
included a new plan or a new setup for tracking, a checklist 

779

of diet suggestions, a referral to other medical providers (e.g. 
a behavioral psychologist or a physical therapist), a physical 
activity  prescription,  or  a  change  in  medication.  The  old 
records might now carry notes or annotations from providers 
and serve as a structuring object for patients to refer to as 
they  engage  in  behavior  change  at  home.  Some  other 
artifacts, such as a printout of the provider’s notes, an email, 
or  patient  notes  on  their  own  phones,  can  also  function 
similarly to aid patients in executing the new plan.

Lee’s  [32]  boundary  negotiating  artifacts  also  include 
borrowed artifacts, which are those taken from the creator, 
augmented  with  other  interpretation,  and  used  in  an 
unanticipated way. However, we did not identify the creation 
or use of borrowed artifacts in our analysis.

Collaboration  occurred  in  all  stages  of  the  personal 
informatics  model  according  to  our  patient  and  provider 
surveys and interviews; however, some of the collaborative 
activities are less supported by current commercial tools. Our 
results  identify  opportunities  for  designers  to  support 
provider and patient goal implementation in the preparation 
and collection stage, goal-oriented and privacy-sensitive data 
curation in the integration stage, and tailored visualizations 
and  interfaces  to  support  collaborative  review  within  and 
outside  of  clinic  visits  in  the  reflection  stage.  We  also 
identify  opportunities  for  researchers  to  further  develop 
theories to support patient-provider collaborations.

The  decision  to  share  tracking  data  with  providers  can 
change patient tracking practices in both provider-initiated 
tracking  and  patient-initiated  tracking.  However,  without 
clear communication about each other’s goals, providers are 
overwhelmed by the excessive amount of data to review, and 
patients  are  frustrated  by  providers  not  valuing  their 
collected data per their expectations [14].  
We do not claim that providers do not spend enough time and 
effort  to  communicate  with  their  patients.  Many  of  our 
participants, in fact, thought their providers have been very 
open to communication, despite frustration with their sharing 
experiences. What we do claim, however, is providers and 
patients lack a mechanism to reach mutual expectations and 
goals during the process of sharing patient-generated data. 
For  example,  even  when  providers  specifically  instruct 
patients  to  only  record  a  specific  type  of  food,  the  apps 
patients use may still require or encourage them to input and 
display other unnecessary information (e.g., calories [11]), 
thereby creating barriers of high burden and excessive data 
for effective review. Systems instead could allow providers 
and patients to configure personalized templates for tracking. 
Similar  to  medication  prescriptions  and  what  Patel  et  al. 
proposed for cancer patient symptom tracking [47], patients 
and providers could set up specific parameters for tracking, 
such  as  items  and  frequency,  based  on  their  sharing  and 
reviewing goals. Lifestyle behavior tracking, however, often

lacks standard metrics, which is different from medication or 
symptom tracking. Therefore, guiding template design with 
communication  around  provider  and  patient  goals 
is 
necessary. For example, if the goal is to identify a specific 
trigger, patients and their providers can decide to only record 
the  specific  type  of  food  with  a  three-day  elimination  and 
three-day introduction. These templates could also be shared 
with  self-trackers  without  having  to  meet  with  providers 
beforehand.  For  example,  if  one  self-tracker  suspects  his 
abdominal pain is triggered from a certain food and would 
like an official evaluation, he can use the template to track his 
food and abdominal pain with adequate detail and frequency. 
(cid:12)(cid:42)(cid:28)(cid:39)(cid:3)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:28)(cid:41)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:44)(cid:36)(cid:48)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:51)(cid:3)(cid:45)(cid:32)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:36)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:48)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:28)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:47)(cid:44)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)
To support their expectations regarding collaborative review 
with  providers,  our  participants  used  various  methods  to 
curate  their  tracking  data.  Curation  between  tracking  and 
review is important for patients to achieve their goals and 
resolve 
their  privacy  concerns.  This  creates  design 
opportunities to better support these activities.  
For a system to support goal-oriented data curation, it could 
provide mechanisms to integrate and summarize data from 
multiple sources, and to curate and filter data based on the 
goals and targets of sharing [15]. This provides flexibility for 
patients  to  use  their  preferred  tracking  tools  that  fit  their 
preference and routine, but still allows them to achieve their 
goal  − sharing and review with their providers. Similar to 
myRecord [3] and Tag-it-Yourself [55], during the curation 
period, these systems could also help patients annotate and 
highlight data with questions or exceptional events to share 
with their providers. This could facilitate agenda setting if it 
is shared before the visit [59], or supply additional contextual 
information necessary to support conversations in the visit.  
For  a  system  to  support  privacy-sensitive  data  curation,  it 
could  provide  sharing  profiles  based  on  the  patient’s 
relationship  with  the  data  recipient.  Similar  to  privacy 
settings in social sharing [e.g., Facebook, 46], users should 
be  able  to  tailor  their  sharing  content  based  on  which 
providers they would want to share and what their sharing 
goals are. This is particularly important for systems seeking 
to  integrate  tracking  data  into  EMR  systems.  Without  the 
options  to  curate  data  before  integration,  it  might  infringe 
patient privacy of data sharing without their notice. 
(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:36)(cid:39)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:25)(cid:36)(cid:45)(cid:47)(cid:28)(cid:39)(cid:36)(cid:52)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:41)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:44)(cid:33)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:33)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)
Time  is  one  of  the  most  limited  resources  for  reviewing 
tracking data in clinic visits. However, when asked whether 
there  is  sufficient  time  to  review  data,  many  patients  we 
interviewed  felt  they  were  given  enough  time,  but  were 
frustrated about not being able to focus on the questions in 
which they were interested (e.g., P17). This demonstrates a 
design opportunity to create goal-oriented visualizations or 
summaries  to  help  focus  the  collaborative  review.  For 
example, if providers and patients want to focus on calorie 
intake and weight for weight loss, there may be no need to 
present nutritional content. On the other hand, if the goal is 
to  identify  potential  food  triggers,  then  specific  food

and

nutrients or components are more important to analyze and 
present than calories.  
To help with motivation and accountability, systems could 
also  support  reflection  on  missing  data.  Features  such  as 
anomaly  identification  have  been  used  to  help  users  self-
identify  their  mistakes  and  explain  irregular  behaviors  
[e.g.,  33].  Similar  features  can  support  patient-provider 
conversations  during  collaborative  review.  For  instance, 
combining  patient  annotation  and  contextual  information 
about  their  routines,  such  as  calendar  events,  could  better 
allow  providers  and  patients  to  identify  barriers  and 
challenges in tracking (e.g., frequent travel disrupting their 
tracking or actual routines), better manage their care outside 
of the clinic office, and provide opportunities to personalize 
the patient’s care plan. Systems could also support patient 
reflection on unarticulated events in their lives by flagging 
missing data for their consideration, instead of just treating it 
as “bad” or “incomplete” data. 
(cid:21)(cid:32)(cid:33)(cid:39)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:34)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:39)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:35)(cid:32)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1)
Using  the  stage-based  model  of  personal  informatics  [34] 
and boundary negotiating artifacts [32] helped us understand 
how 
using  
patient-generated  data.  However,  we  also  found  a  need  to 
address  issues  uncovered  for  applying  these  models  and 
theories  to  patient-provider  collaboration  with  self-tracked 
data. In this section, we reflect on the nature and process of 
patient-provider  collaboration  in  tracking  and  sharing 
patient-generated  data  to  suggest  considerations  for  future 
development of these theories and models. 
Reflecting on the stage-based model of personal informatics, 
we observe a need to extend the model with individual roles 
in each stage of what is, for many, a social and collaborative 
process. Although collaboration occurs in every stage of the 
personal informatics model, individuals might play different 
roles and conduct different types of activity independently 
and collaboratively. For example, in the preparation stage, 
providers might plan to educate patients about what and how 
to  track  while  patients  might  plan  to  adopt  the  tracking 
process  into  their  daily  routines;  together  they  make  a 
feasible  tracking  plan.  Similarly,  when  collaboratively 
reviewing data, providers might examine tracking data for 
common symptom triggers while patients might reflect on 
contextual factors that affect their exposure to those triggers. 
When integrating both analyses, providers and patients can 
adopt actionable treatment plans and lifestyle changes. 
There is also a need to plan for lapsing and stopping when 
applying 
to  patient-provider 
collaboration on tracking and reviewing. Collaboration can 
be  terminated  by  either  party  during  or  between  stages. 
Patients might lapse in collecting data [16]. Providers, facing 
time and compensation constraints, might not be incentivized 
to review the data as thoroughly or at all. This might in turn 
cause patients to stop bringing their data to the clinic. The 
lived 
informatics  model  by  Epstein  et  al.  suggests 
opportunities  and  possible  strategies  for  designing  for 

the  stage-based  model 

that 

transformed 

lapsing  and  resuming  tracking  [16].  We  emphasize  the 
importance of designing not just for lapses in and resumption 
of  individual  tracking,  but  also  in  collaborative  tracking. 
Further, it is possible for parties to asymmetrically lapse or 
resume. As seen among our participants, a provider might 
lapse in reviewing data before a patient is ready. A patient, 
facing a flare up in symptoms or weight gain, might resume 
tracking  but  without  the  provider  support  he  or  she 
previously had.  
The social nature of collaboration work inevitably leads to 
privacy  concerns,  particularly  in  the  context  of  health 
information.  As  different  boundary  negotiating  artifacts  are 
formed  and 
from  patient-generated  data 
throughout the collaboration process, patient perspectives of 
privacy  change  and  need  to  be  addressed  accordingly. 
Reflecting on Nissenbaum’s privacy as contextual integrity 
[43], we caution practitioners and researchers to be attentive 
to the complex norms of appropriateness and distribution of 
patient-provider collaboration when applying both models. 
Future  research  should  also  extend  collaboration  around 
patient-generated data to include other members of their peer 
support and care networks and further develop the theories 
based on these nuances. While our study focuses on IBS and 
weight  management  populations,  we  believe 
the 
opportunities to apply and extend current models and theory 
will  be  informative  for  other  forms  of  collaboration  using 
self-tracking  data.  For  example,  financial  advisors  review 
client financial data, personal trainers prepare workout plans 
and review journals, and many families review budgets and 
bills together. 
(cid:16)(cid:36)(cid:40)(cid:36)(cid:46)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:45)(cid:1)
Our survey samples could have self-selection bias in favor of 
patients and providers who are more open to or interested in 
use of self-tracking data. However, these samples provided 
us an in-depth understanding of what currently happens in 
patient-generated data sharing with providers in populations 
with obesity and IBS. Our study is also limited to an analysis 
of  self-reported  patient  and  provider  experiences  and 
perceptions  of  their  experiences  with  shared  data.  The 
collaborative experiences likely built upon the typical long-
term relationships between the providers and patients in our 
study and organizational factors of the health system from 
which  we  recruited.  Future  observational  studies  could 
provide more insights on patient-provider interactions with 
self-tracking data in various clinical settings.  
(cid:8)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:14)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:1)
Building on the stage-based model of personal informatics, 
we observe and present patient expectations for sharing self-
tracking  data  with  their  health  care  providers  and  how 
collaboration takes place in different stages. In addition, we 
adopted  the  theory  of  boundary  negotiating  artifacts  to 
describe how current tracking tools and data support provider 
and  patient  collaboration.  Grounded  in  these  theories,  our 
study contributes an understanding of the design and use of 
self-tracking data in IBS and weight management patients.

Despite  successful  use  cases,  many  barriers  and  concerns 
prevent each party from performing individual activities or 
from collaborating effectively with each other.  Designers of 
personal informatics systems should work to include features 
that  better  support  patient-provider  collaboration.  These 
features  should  support  goal 
implementation  during 
preparation and collection stages, goal oriented and privacy-
sensitive  data  curation  during  the  integration  stage,  and 
tailored visualizations and interfaces for collaborative review 
during the reflection stage. 
To avoid miscommunication, healthcare providers and patients 
should have explicit conversations about intended use of the 
data  by  each  party.  Healthcare  providers  who  integrate 
patient self-tracking data into their practice should consider 
the different roles their patients and they play in initiating, 
supporting, and terminating the collaboration. They should 
also  be  conscious  of  patient  privacy  needs  and  suggest 
appropriate granularity and duration of tracking and sharing. 
We also suggest further development of models of personal 
informatics and the theory of boundary negotiating artifacts 
based on the social nature of patient-provider collaboration. 
Researchers should elaborate on personal informatics models 
(e.g.,  [16,34])  to  reflect  the  role  self-trackers  and  their 
collaborators,  including  experts,  play  in  each  stage  of  the 
process  and  how  these  roles  may  shift.  CSCW researchers 
should place importance on the norms, uses, and privacy needs 
associated  with  data  when  applying  the  theory  of  boundary 
negotiating 
patient-provider 
collaboration and other collaborations involving personal data.
