ABSTRACT 
Virtual 
form  of 
organizing,  but  the  impact  of  social  structures  within  and 
between 
remains 
understudied. This paper uses the case study of a massively 
multiplayer  online  game  and  server  log  data  from  over 
10,000  players  to  examine  the  connection  between  group 
social  capital  (operationalized 
through  guild  network 
structure measures) and team effectiveness, given a variety 
of  in-game  social  networks.  Three  different  networks, 
social,  task,  and  exchange  networks,  are  compared  and 
contrasted while controlling for group size, group age, and 
player  experience.  Team  effectiveness  is  maximized  at  a 
roughly  moderate  level  of  closure  across  the  networks, 
suggesting  that  this  is  the  optimal  level  of  the  group’s 
network density. Guilds with high brokerage, meaning they 
have  diverse  connections  with  other  groups,  were  more 
effective  in  achievement-oriented  networks.  In  addition, 
guilds  with central leaders  were more effective  when they 
teamed up with other guild leaders.

people  to  communicate  and  collaborate  over  a  virtual

In  many  of 

complete  projects.  At  Intel,  for  example,  70  percent  of 
employees worked without meeting face-to-face (61 percent 
used  internet  conferencing),  and  44  percent  worked  on 
teams with changing members [8]. One advantage of VTs is 
that they can coordinate synchronously or asynchronously, 
as  they  are  not  limited  by  geographic  dependence  [41]. 
Although they are useful, depending on the purpose, some 
projects  may  be  more  successful  using  face-to-face  (FTF) 
teams.  For  example,  traditional  work  groups  can  be  more 
focused and have stable group members [21]. 
In  contrast  to  FTF  groups,  many  VTs  are  complex  and 
multi-purposed.  The  purpose  of  the  team  may  not  be  as 
focused, with one project overlapping into the next. Often, 
VT  members  are  not  limited  to  one  work  group,  as 
individuals  can  easily  move  from  one  team  to  another 
within  the  organization.  This  fluid  and  boundary-spanning 
behavior is common in VTs [41], especially as the number 
of VT members can vary widely.  
VTs are used in formal organizations, as well as in online 
communities. 
these  emerging  virtual 
organizations, such as open source software (OSS) projects 
and  massively  multiplayer  online  games  (MMOGs),  VTs 
are  self-organized  and  it  is  not  uncommon  for  VTs  to 
operate without an assigned leader. In OSS collaborations, 
spontaneous  VTs  are  often  formed  by  distant  members  to 
complete coding projects. Individuals are motivated to join 
these  VTs  to  increase  their  notoriety,  enjoyment  from 
contributing, desire for software improvements, and social- 
and career-related advantages in the software industry [23]. 
VTs are also common in MMOGs where players can work 
in VTs to advance their individual progress by completing 
team  challenges.  To  ensure  team  success,  individuals  are 
motivated  to  both  coordinate  actions  and  form  social 
relationships with other players on their VTs [27]. 
Because  VTs  are  fluid, 
the 
configuration of VTs impacts their productivity remains an 
important  yet  understudied  question.  As  described  above, 
MMOGs provide mechanisms for teams to form online, and 
therefore  they  make  a  good  proxy  for  studying  online 
groups. In this paper, we examine how social structures and 
“group  social  capital”  impact  teams’  success.  We  look 
explicitly at both the connection within as well as between 
teams to see how certain kinds of social networks and their 
composition lead to increased group effectiveness.

Teams in MMOGs 
MMOGs frequently provide mechanisms for teams to form 
online.  Broadly  defined,  MMOGs  are  two  or  three-
dimensional  persistent  online  worlds  where  participants 
interact  with  a  mediated  environment  and  other  human 
players [7,39]. Represented by avatars, players can engage 
in combat, earn money, make transactions, complete quests, 
and interact with other players through various groups and 
communication  channels.  Playing  MMOGs  often  requires 
dedication.  A  cross-game  survey  showed 
that  many 
individuals play an average of 20 hours per week, similar to 
a second job [47]. Because of the complexity of quests and 
combat  in  these  worlds,  success  in  MMOGs  typically 
requires – besides long hours – creative teamwork, similar 
to success in formal organizations [47]. 
By  design,  most  MMOGs  encourage  collaborative  play 
through  1)  an  elaborate  division  of  labor  so  that  players 
possess  distinct  and  complementary  skill  sets,  and  2) 
various 
player 
collaboration [9]. Two general categories of teams exist in 
MMOGs. The first type includes short-term, ad hoc teams 
that come together to complete a task; these teams tend to 
separate  after  their  success  or  failure,  often  in  a  matter  of 
hours  [25].  Due  to  the  ephemeral  nature  of  ad  hoc  teams, 
they are also referred to as “pick up groups” (PUGs). Most 
MMOGs provide matchmaking functions to connect players 
that  are  looking  to  join  an  ad  hoc  team  (such  as  those 
tagged  as  “Looking  For  Group”;  [39]).  Although  some  ad 
hoc teams are repeatedly organized among the same set of 
players,  most  are  temporary  and  formed  between  people 
that do not necessarily share a prior history of interaction. 
There  are  often  few  barriers  for  entry  and  exit,  as 
membership  is  fluid  and  the  team  boundaries  are  weakly 
defined.  
This study focuses exclusively on a second type of MMOG 
teams: guilds. Compared to PUGs, guilds possess a  more-
stable  social  structure  –  comparable 
to 
traditional and virtual work groups in formal and informal 
organizations  –  and 
semi-permanent 
organizational structure. Joining a  guild is often  necessary 
to progress to higher levels and gain access to advantaged 
resources [13], and studies have shown  that the likelihood 
of being in a guild increases steadily as players advance in 
the  game  [39].  Guilds  are  identified  by  a  unique  guild 
name, and they can have membership sizes ranging from a 
few  to  hundreds  of  players.  MMOGs  provide  designated 
meeting places for guilds and specific functions to support 
within-guild  communication  and  coordination  (such  as  a 
guild chat channel, guild bank, and guild leadership roster). 
Guilds  can  be  categorized  depending  on  their  goals  and 
play styles, including those that promote some combination 
of  social  interactions,  competition  in  player-versus-player 
(PvP) battles, team-building to progress through stages, and 
role-playing to act out their characters [44]. These different 
purposes create opportunities for guild members to develop

members.  
As well as being intended for entertainment purposes, many 
MMOGs  replicate  rules  and  standards  for  organizational 
success.  Because  of  the  similarities  between  MMOGs  and 
other organizations, there are many advantages to studying 
VT  development  and  management,  using  MMOGs  as  a 
testing bed for team research. One advantage is that some 
teams,  such  as  guilds,  play  with  each  other  for  longer 
periods  of  time,  allowing  for  longitudinal  studies  of  real 
teams and their group dynamics [1]. In addition, studies on 
MMOGs  may replicate patterns in other synchronous VTs 
[16].  MMOG  studies  can 
these  patterns  using 
traditional  surveys  [16]  or  by  using  behavioral  data  from 
player  actions  [25].  Various  VT  performance  factors  can 
also be evaluated through group-level effects on individual 
player  success  [16]  or  the  group’s  overall  success.  In  this 
paper,  we  use  one  MMOG  to  test  the  ideal  levels  of 
different types of social dependence, in both affiliation- and 
task-oriented  social  networks,  which  maximizes  each 
team’s overall performance. 
Virtual Team Effectiveness 
Team  performance  consists  of  three  factors:  1)  exceeding 
standards (in quality or quantity) of the productive output, 
2)  using  social  norms  that  collectively  maximize  group 
members’ 
interactions,  and  3) 
creating a positive learning experience for group members 
[20].  Empirically,  work  group  effectiveness 
is  often 
quantified  by  the  group  supervisor’s  evaluations  [30,  33] 
sales [30], or customer loyalty [30]. MMOGs measure team 
performance through a system of point leveling at both the 
individual and group level. 
Studies have illustrated various factors that may affect VT 
performance, yet few have shown how the social structure 
both  within  and  across 
influence  VT 
effectiveness 
research  on  VT 
effectiveness only looks at teams as isolated units [12,16], 
given  a  problem  of  size;  in  this  paper,  we  extend  that 
foundation  to  ask  how  the  structure  of  teams  impacts 
success, especially situating teams amongst each other in a 
larger  network  (because,  again,  teams  are  frequently  not 
isolated and interact  with other groups). Using  guilds in a 
large MMOG called Dragon Nest (DN) as a case study, we 
adapt Oh, Chung, & Labianca’s [33] theoretical framework 
of  “group  social  capital”  to  test  how  social  capital  within 
and beyond teams affect their overall effectiveness. 
Group Social Capital and Virtual Teams 
Social capital has been a widely used concept in technology 
research. It broadly refers to an actor’s access to resources 
based on their social ties and structural position in a social 
system  [17,18,35].  Like  other  forms  of  capital,  social 
capital could help individuals and groups achieve economic 
and social goals. Definitions of social capital recognize its 
individual and collective dimensions. For example, Burt [5] 
defines  social  capital  as  “the  advantage  created  by  a

person’s  location  in  a  structure  of  relationships”  (5).  By 
contrast,  Putnam  [35]  defines  social  capital  as  “social 
networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness 
that  arise  from  them”  (19).  Social  capital  provides  an 
especially  useful  framework  to  examine  group  processes, 
whereby individual social relationships  within and beyond 
group boundaries create a multilayered social structure that 
contributes to overall group effectiveness.  
Oh,  Chung,  and  Labianca  [33]  proposed  a  “group  social 
capital”  framework  and  conducted  an  empirical  test  in 
traditional organizational work groups. They defined group 
social capital as “the configuration of a group’s members’ 
social relationships within the social structure of the group 
itself,  as  well  as  in  the  broader  social  structure  of  the 
organization  to  which  the  group  belongs,  through  which 
necessary  resources  for  the  group  can  be  accessed”  (861). 
This framework considers both the social structure within a 
group  and  the  larger  network  of  the  organization  within 
which the individuals and groups are embedded. Groups are 
not 
through 
members’  cross-group  relationships  contributes  to  the 
collective  social  resources  of  the  group.  In  other  words, 
group  social  capital  matters  because  an  optimal  structural 
configuration  within, as  well  as outside of, the group  may 
generate benefits greater than the sum of all the individuals’ 
social  capital.  Given  the  high  degree  of  fluidity  and 
boundary-spanning activities in VTs, this framework allows 
us to examine the effectiveness of these teams as they are 
formed  and  sustained  through  multilayered  interpersonal 
networks across organizational boundaries.  
The  original  group  social  capital  framework  used  work 
groups  from  a  Korean  corporation  to  test  the  network  of 
informal socializing ties (friendships) on team performance 
[28].  Using 
framework  measured 
intragroup/intergroup  friendships  and  the  network  of  the 
leaders  on  supervisors’  evaluations  of  group 
group 
performance.  They  found  that  a  moderate  density  of 
friendships within and a high level of  friendships between 
work groups led to the greatest overall performance. In the 
study,  the  effects  of  the  leaders’  network  were  not 
significant.  
This  paper  extends  Oh  et  al.’s  [33]  study  to  a  MMOG 
context  and  includes  two  additional  social  networks. 
Following this framework, we consider two main structural 
mechanisms that link social capital with VT effectiveness. 
two  mechanisms  –  closure  and  brokerage  – 
These 
acknowledge that team effectiveness can be affected by 1) a 
team’s  inner  social  structure  (intragroup  network),  and  2) 
how teams are positioned within the overall social structure 
of the organization (intergroup network).  
Intragroup closure 
Social  capital  research  points  to  two  distinct  types  of 
structure 
that  may  generate  advantage:  closure  and 
brokerage  [5,40].  Closure  refers  to  the  type  of  structure 
where connected dyads also share many common ties. For 

surveys, 

example, in a small group of three actors A, B, and C, high 
closure means everyone is connected to everyone else. High 
closure  can  lead  to  more  moral  behaviors  and  more  trust 
towards each other, as actors’ behaviors are kept in check 
by  shared  social  contacts  who  know  each  other  [11].  The 
redundancy  of  connections  also  ensures 
information, 
opinions,  and  norms  are  reinforced  within  the  network, 
giving rise to stronger ties, reciprocity, and group solidarity 
[11,35].  
Research  has  established  the  link  between  closure  and 
group  productivity.  Information  available  through  strong 
and  closed  ties  is  often  more  trusted  and  readily  available 
[28],  reducing  opportunism  and  transaction  costs  for  all 
members.  Closed  networks  also  provide  socioemotional 
support,  creating  group  resilience  during  difficult  setbacks 
[35,42].  Work  groups  with  greater  density  of  informal 
friendship also tend to have  greater customer loyalty [30], 
productivity  [37],  and  overall 
task  performance  [3]. 
Compared  to  traditional  work  groups,  virtual  teams  in 
MMOGs  can  be  especially  susceptible  to  opportunistic 
behaviors  because  of  their  fluid  boundaries.  A  closed 
intragroup  network  can  create  trust,  refocusing  group 
resources  from  behavioral  monitoring  to  accomplishing 
joint  tasks.    In  VTs,  factors  of  trust  during  the  life  of  the 
team  may  vary.  High  trust  can  be  formed  initially  when 
group  members  connect  socially,  take  initiative,  and  have 
enthusiastic interactions. High trust is maintained in a group 
through regular and task-focused communication, and when 
leaders  use  positive  communication  [26].  Research  in 
MMOGs 
that  communication  between  guild 
members, such as voice chat, also breeds trust [36]. Dyads 
that  are  embedded  in  closed  networks  are  more  likely  to 
trust each other too [40]. Finally, groups with greater levels 
of trust and communication have greater task performance 
in both FTF teams [12] and VTs in software development 
[38].  
However,  the  performance  advantage  of  closure  is  not 
infinite.  When  actors  are  too  tightly  connected  within  a 
group, they become insulated and may have less diverse ties 
that  connect  them  to  the  information  and  resources 
available outside of the closed group [17]. Others have also 
suggested that VT performance in MMOGs may not rely on 
trust as much as in other VT contexts [16]. Because of these 
contradictory  mechanisms,  some  have  suggested 
that 
closure often follows an inverted-U relationship with group 
effectiveness,  where  the  maximum  effectiveness  is  at  a 
moderate level of density [33]. Therefore, we propose that: 
H1:  Intragroup  closure  will  have  an  inverted  U-shaped 
relationship with team effectiveness. 
Intergroup brokerage 
The  second  type  of  structure  generating  social  capital  is 
brokerage,  where  a  tie  connects  otherwise  unconnected 
others  (called  a  structural  hole)  [5].  The  performance 
advantage  of  brokerage  comes 
from  contact  with 
heterogeneous  members  who  provide  access  to  diverse, 

show 

681

than 

redundant, 

to 

spread 

information  and 

rather 
resources. 
Heterogeneity within the organization may come from both 
vertical and horizontal boundaries [34]. Vertical boundaries 
are  those  between  people  at  different  hierarchical  levels, 
such as directors, middle managers, and junior employees. 
Horizontal  boundaries  refer  to  those  between  various 
functional  units and project groups, such as the  marketing 
division  and  sales  division.    At  the  group  level,  insulated 
groups  may  not  have  access  to  informational  clusters  in 
other social cliques.  Affiliative social relations often cross 
formal  hierarchical  barriers 
information 
throughout a system. These intergroup social relations can 
often  better  predict  economic  success  compared 
to 
workplace relations based on job positions [18]. 
In virtual worlds, the link between brokerage and individual 
task performance is well established [6,40]. MMOGs do not 
typically  have  a  hierarchical  structure  like  traditional 
organizations,  and  entry  and  exit  costs  associated  with 
guilds  are  very  low.  As  such,  the  most  salient  boundary-
spanning  activities  are  connecting  with  people  outside  of 
the  guild.    These  relationships  with  external  members  cut 
across  horizontal  boundaries  and  expose  individuals  to 
heterogeneous ideas and knowledge, as well as instrumental 
and  social  support,  which  in  turn  benefits  the  group  as  a 
whole. Therefore, we propose that: 
H2:  Groups  with  greater  bridging  diversity  with  other 
groups will be more effective. 
Vertically, 
influence  over 
practices, policies, and their group’s actions. Groups whose 
leaders  are  well-connected  with  other  leaders  have  higher 
group  performance  [3].  In  MMOGs,  guild  leaders  often 
mediate  conflicts,  enforce  guild  rules,  and  act  as  advisors 
[44].  Group  leaders  with  access  and  contacts  to  other 
leaders may be able to learn diverse organizing practice and 
effective  policies.  Further,  players  who  are  leaders  in  an 
MMOG are also offline leaders in voluntary organizations, 
suggesting  that  some  leadership  skills  cross  offline-online 
boundaries [29]. Therefore, we propose that: 
H3: Groups whose leaders have more ties to other leaders 
will be more effective. 
DATA & METHOD 
Dragon Nest 
The  data  for  this  study  are  drawn  from  a  large  MMOG, 
Dragon  Nest  (DN),  a  fantasy  game  developed  by 
Eyedentity Games. The Chinese version of the game, from 
which  our  data  is  drawn,  is  operated  by  Shanda  Games 
Limited.  Currently,  the  free-to-play  game  is  available  for 
players in Korea, China, North  America, South East  Asia, 
and Europe. While not identical, both our study and Oh et 
al.’s [33] study include Asian populations, we use a sample 
of  Chinese  players  and  Oh  et  al.  [33]  uses  a  sample  of 
Korean employees. By testing the  same hypotheses drawn 
from  similar  cultures,  we  expected  similar  results.  The 
behavioral  dataset  was  made  available  by  the  game

period (01/01/2011 to 03/31/2011; [25]).  
To  traverse  and  interact  with  the  virtual  world,  Lagendia, 
players  can  create  avatars  from  different  classes,  such  as 
warrior,  archer,  cleric,  and  sorceress.  The  purpose  of  the 
game  is  to  awaken  a  poisoned  goddess  by  defeating 
dungeons  and  dragons  and  discovering  power  stones  [25]. 
Players can interact with other players through chat, team or 
guild  collaborations,  trading  currency  or  items,  or  by 
joining guilds. 
Sampling 
A guild in our sample was included in our analysis if it was 
founded  during  the  collection  period  and  if  the  guild  had 
more than three characters on the last day of the collection 
period. There were a total of 804 guilds in the sample. The 
minimum  number  of  characters  in  a  guild  was  four 
members, and the  maximum  number of characters  was 97 
(M = 14.31, SD = 15.42). All members of each guild were 
included  in  the  analysis,  resulting  in  a  total  of  11,549 
characters. Players can create multiple characters, so some 
network  connections  may 
two 
characters  from  the  same  player.  Character  levels  ranged 
from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 40 (M = 26.9, SD = 
9.7).  At  the  time  of  collection,  level  40  was  the  highest 
achievable level. 
Networks 
Using the sample of all 11,549 guild members in the sample 
of  804  guilds,  three  distinct  networks  were  constructed 
from the behavioral log data. The three networks included 
social,  task,  and  exchange  networks  (explained  below). 
When  two  guild  members  in  the  sample  shared  either  a 
social,  task,  and  exchange  tie,  a  connection  was  drawn 
between  the  nodes  in  the  graph.  Using  these  ties,  two 
networks were constructed: an intragroup and an intergroup 
network.  The  intragroup  network  was  constructed  by 
analyzing  character  ties  within  each  guild.  To  create  a 
guild-guild network, individual character actions in each of 
the  three  networks  were  aggregated.  All  guilds  and  guild 
members  were  included  in  the  final  network,  including 
isolates. 
Social network 
We constructed an undirected social network by recording 
if two characters in the sample connected with each other as 
“friends”  in  the  game  interface.  8,662  of  the  11,549  guild 
members had 19,361 social ties (average # friends = 6.69). 
The social network was then aggregated into a social guild-
guild  network.  In  the  guild-guild  network,  26  of  the  804 
guilds had no social ties with other guilds. 
Exchange network 
We  constructed  an  undirected  exchange  network  by 
recording  if  two  characters  in  the  sample  made  a  trading 
transaction  during  the  collection  period.  The  exchange 
network  was  weighted  by  the  total  number  of  trading 
transactions  between  the  characters.  8,220  of  the  11,549 
characters shared 30,457 total trading ties. Once aggregated 

682

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

they  were  analyzed  and 

into  the  guild-guild  network,  27  of  the  804  guilds  had  no 
intergroup exchange ties. 
Task network 
We constructed an undirected task network by recording if 
two  characters  in  the  sample  played  with  each  other  in  a 
team  “party”  instance  (i.e.  a  PUG).  The  network  was 
weighted by the total  number of shared instances between 
the  guild  member  pairs.  The  network  included  11,549 
characters with 294,956 party ties. 1,294 characters had no 
task  ties  with  other  characters  within  the  guild  member 
sample.  After  aggregating  the  task  network  into  a  guild-
guild  network,  6  of  the  804  guilds  in  the  sample  were 
isolates. 
Network correlations 
We  compared 
three  player-player  networks  and 
the 
conducted an inter-network correlation using the Quadratic 
Assignment  (QAP)  correlation  method,  which  statistically 
tests  the  correlations  between  networks.  The  networks  all 
had  small  but  significant  correlations.  The  social  and  task 
networks  had  the  largest  correlation  (r2  =  .25,  p  <  .001), 
followed by the social and exchange networks (r2 = .13, p < 
.001), and finally the task and exchange networks (r2 = .05, 
p  <  .001).  Because  the  three  networks  did  not  have  too 
much  overlap, 
interpreted 
separately.  
Leadership network 
Finally,  a  leadership  network  was  constructed  by  taking  a 
subset  of  guild  leaders  with  network  ties  with  other  guild 
leaders on the last day of the collection period. In the social 
network, 349 leaders had a total of 286 friendship ties with 
other guild leaders, while 455 leaders had no friendship ties 
to  other  leaders.  In  the  task  network,  434  leaders  have 
played in a PUG with other leaders while 370 have no inter-
leader PUG ties. In the exchange network, 437 leaders have 
traded  with  other  leaders,  and  567  have  no  inter-leader 
trading ties.  
MODEL 
To  test  our  hypotheses,  we  created  and  tested  various 
hierarchical 
guild 
effectiveness.  Correlations  and  descriptive  statistics  for  all 
of  the  variables  are  reported  in  Table  1.  To  improve  the 
interpretability  of  coefficients  in  a  polynomial  regression, 
all  predictors  were  centered  (Table  2),  as  suggested  by 
Cohen et al. (204) [10]. 
Independent and Dependent Variables 
Guild effectiveness 
The dependent variable, guild effectiveness, is based on the 
amount of guild points a guild has achieved on the last day 
of the collection period. Guild points are earned by the team 
completing quests, such as dungeons and commissions [19]. 
To advance a guild level in Dragon Nest, a guild must have 
earned a certain number of guild points, currency, and guild 
members.  The  effectiveness  measure  is  the  average  of  the 
total  guild  points  based  on  the  number  of  members  in  a 
guild on the last day of the collection period. Because the 

regression  models 

to 

predict 

683

distribution  of  guild  effectiveness  was  highly  skewed,  we 
log-transformed this variable (M = 8.89, SD = 1.07). 
To  predict  guild  effectiveness,  we  included  independent 
variables related to guild-level network measures. We also 
included a number of guild-level and character-level control 
variables. 
Intragroup closure (density) 
Similar to Oh et al. [33] , density and density squared were 
used as measure to test intragroup closure. In an egocentric 
approach,  density  was  calculated  using  the  network  ties 
within each guild. The social network used an unweighted 
density measure (M = 0.16, SD = 0.21) by dividing the total 
number of friendship ties within each guild by the potential 
ties based on the number of characters in the guild:  

(cid:7)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:155)(cid:3404)(cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:133)(cid:150)(cid:151)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:135)(cid:149)
(cid:19)(cid:145)(cid:150)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:135)(cid:149) 
(cid:19)(cid:145)(cid:150)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:131)(cid:142)(cid:3)(cid:150)(cid:139)(cid:135)(cid:149)(cid:3404)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:1499)(cid:4666)(cid:17)(cid:3398)(cid:883)(cid:4667)
(cid:884)

 

The potential ties were calculated using: 

where N is the number of characters in the guild. Isolates, 
those without intragroup ties, were included in the density 
measure.  111  guilds  had  a  density  of  0,  as  they  had  no 
intragroup social ties. 
The  task  and  exchange  networks  used  weighted  density 
measures. These were weighted to account for the strength 
of instances shared between actors. For example, two actors 
who  have  played  on  fifty  PUGs  together  likely  have  a 
stronger relationship than those who have only played once 
together. The task network was weighted by the number of 
shared  task  instances  between  an  actor  and  an  alter.  The 
exchange  network  was  weighted  by  the  total  number  of 
exchange  transactions  between  an  actor  and  an  alter.  The 
number of weighted intragroup ties was summed, squared, 
and  divided  by  the  potential  ties  to  measure  density.  The 
weighted density was then normalized on a scale from 0 to 
1 for both the task network (M = 0.01, SD = 0.04) and the 
exchange  network  (M  =  0.02,  SD  =  0.05).  In  the  task 
network,  101  guilds  had  a  density  of  0,  as  they  had  no 
intragroup  task  ties.  The  exchange  network  had  27  guilds 
with no intragroup exchange ties. 
Because we hypothesized an inverted U-shaped relationship 
between  closure  and  team  effectiveness,  density  squared 
was  also  included  in  the  models.  The  quadratic  maximum 
was  calculated  in  each  of  the  three  models  as  a  way  to 
estimate  the  point  of  density  at  which  performance  is 
maximized. Using the regression of centered predictors,  

(cid:28)(cid:3404)(cid:5)(cid:2869)(cid:7)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:155)(cid:3397)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:2870)(cid:7)(cid:135)(cid:144)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:155)(cid:2870)(cid:3397)(cid:15)(cid:4666)(cid:27)(cid:2870)(cid:481)(cid:27)(cid:2871)(cid:481)(cid:27)(cid:2872)(cid:481)(cid:27)(cid:2873)(cid:481)(cid:27)(cid:2874)(cid:481)(cid:27)(cid:2875)(cid:4667)(cid:3397)(cid:5)(cid:2868) 
where (cid:1838) is  a  linear  function  of  the  other  predictors,  the 
maximum  of  the  quadratic  equation  ((cid:1850)(cid:1839))  was  calculated 

using the derivative of the equation: 

(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:3404)(cid:3)(cid:3398)(cid:5)(cid:883)(cid:884)(cid:5)(cid:884) 

the density squared predictor was added to (cid:1850)(cid:1839). 

To  rescale  the  centered  quadratic  maximum  to  its  0  to  1 
scale for comparison across the three networks, the mean of 

Intergroup brokerage (Blau’s Diversity Index) 
To  test  bridging  capital,  or  intergroup  brokerage,  we 
included  a  measure  of  inter-guild  heterogeneity  to  show 
group-level  diversity  in  each  group’s  connections  to  other 
groups.  Brokerage  was  calculated  using  Blau’s  diversity 
index of heterogeneity [4], measured using the formula: 

(cid:5)(cid:148)(cid:139)(cid:134)(cid:137)(cid:139)(cid:144)(cid:137)(cid:3)(cid:134)(cid:139)(cid:152)(cid:135)(cid:148)(cid:149)(cid:139)(cid:150)(cid:155)(cid:3404)(cid:883)(cid:3398)(cid:3)(cid:3533)(cid:19)(cid:2919)(cid:2870)(cid:1499)(cid:19)(cid:2919) 

this  measure  using 

ties.  We  calculated 

Pi represents the proportional tie influence of each guild’s 
shared network ties, based on the total number of external 
network 
the 
interguild network adjacency matrix. Each cell was divided 
by the guild’s total interguild network ties and then squared. 
Then,  the  sum  of  each  row  in  the  matrix  was  subtracted 
from  1  to  develop  a  guild-level  diversity  measure.  The 
index ranges from 0 (no diversity) to 1.00 (high diversity). 
The social network used an  unweighted bridging diversity 
measure (M = 0.89, SD = 0.21) and had 33 isolates with no 
interguild  social  ties.  The  task  network  was  weighted  by 
shared  task  instances  (M  =  0.89,  SD  =  0.22)  and  had  38 
isolates with no interguild task ties. Exchange was weighted 
by  shared  exchange  instances  (M  =  0.72,  SD  =  0.37)  and 
had 152 isolate guilds with no intergroup exchange ties. 
Intergroup leadership (centrality) 
Finally,  to  measure  the  impact  of  well-connected  group 
leaders,  we  calculated  leadership  degree  centrality  as  an 
intergroup 
leadership  measure.  We  calculated  degree 
centrality of the leadership network by summing each guild 
leader’s  total  number  of  ties  with  other  leaders.  This  was 
performed  using 
leader-leader  adjacency  matrix, 
summing each row to develop a guild-level measure for the 
social network (M = 0.56, SD = 1.67), the task network (M 
= 7.13, SD = 12.85), and the exchange network (M = 1.19, 
SD = 3.73). Many of the leaders did not have network ties 
to other leaders, as there were many isolated guilds in the 
social  (635  isolates),  task  (370),  and  exchange  (567) 
networks. 
Control Variables 
Group size 
In organizations, larger groups have greater legitimacy and 
access  to  diverse  resources  and  individuals,  but  they  may 
also have less cohesion [32]. In MMOGs, larger guilds are 
typically  more  concerned  with  progressing  in  the  game, 
while  smaller  guilds  often  encourage  social  relations  [44]. 
Larger guilds also tend to be more formally organized [44], 
which  tends  to  encourage  efficiency  in  organizations. 
Following  Oh  et  al.,  we  included  group  size  as  a  control 
variable  [33].  The  number  of  members  in  a  group  was 
measured using the character count in the guild, calculated 
by measuring the total number of characters in the guild on 
the last day of the collection. 

the 

SESSION: MUSEUMS AND PUBLIC SPACES

Experience 
In  formal  organizations,  more  experience  or  tenure  often 
leads  to  greater  performance  [31].  Similarly,  in  MMOGs, 
players  interact  with  others  in  teams  at  levels  similar  to 
themselves,  resulting  in  differences  in  team  performance 
[14,25]. In DN, the characters’ levels in a guild is related to 
the  amount  of  guild  points  a  guild  can  earn  [19].  The 
average experience level of group members was measured 
using  the  average  guild  member  level  in  DN.  The 
experience measure took the average of the level each guild 
member achieved by the last day of collection. This resulted 
in a guild-level experience measure. 
Group age 
Groups collaborating over a long time  will likely be more 
effective  than  newly  formed  groups.  Therefore,  a  control 
for the age of the guild in days was calculated.  
Total number of ties 
The  total  number  of  informal  ties  was  controlled  by 
summing the number of ties within and between each guild. 
Using  the  guild-guild  adjacency  matrix,  a  sum  of  each  of 
the  rows  was  calculated  to  develop  a  guild-level  control 
measure of network ties. Total number of ties was included 
to control for network size, similar to Oh et al. [33]. 
RESULTS 
We  ran  four  models  for  each  network  to  predict  team 
effectiveness.  The  first  model  set  a  baseline  by  including 
only  control  variables.  The  second  model  included  intra-
group  closure,  while  the  third  model  added  inter-group 
brokerage,  and 
incorporated 
leadership. All four models are significant (p < .001). The 
predictors  were  selected  and  hierarchically  ordered  in  the 
model based on previous literature on group social capital, 
such  as  [33].  Below,  we  report  the  results  from  the  most 
comprehensive  model,  Model  4.  In  this  model,  we  also 
justified  the  inclusion  of  a  quadratic  term  in  each  of  the 
three  networks  by  testing  the  difference  in  prediction  by 
adding the quadratic term to a fully linear model (213) [10]. 
The  χ2  test  between  models  was  significant  for  the  social 
network (p = .010) and highly significant for both the task 
and exchange network (p < .001). 
Controls 
Overall,  the  results  from  the  controls  suggest  that  guild 
effectiveness increases for all three networks as the number 
of guild members, the average experience level, and the age 
of the guild increases. For the social and task network, an 
increase in the total number of network ties also predicted 
guild effectiveness. 
Intragroup Closure 
Intragroup  closure  tested  the  effect  of  intragroup  density 
and  density  squared  on  effectiveness.  The  social  network 
used original density measures, while the task and exchange 
networks included weighted density measures. The squared 
density  was  included  because  of  the  expectation  of  a 
curvilinear relationship between density and effectiveness.

In  the  social  network,  density  is  not  related  to  guild 
effectiveness  (t  =  1.45;  p  =  .146)  but  the  squared  density 
measure is significantly and negatively related; t = -2.57, p 
= .010. In the task network, both the density (t = 6.03; p < 
.001)  and  density  squared  (t  =  -6.53;  p  <  .001)  predictors 
were  significant.  In  the  exchange  network,  density  is 
significantly  related  to  guild  effectiveness  (t  =  3.80;  p  < 
.001), as well as the squared density predictor (t = -4.05; p 
< .001).  
All  three  networks  had  a  somewhat  moderate  quadratic 
maximum.  The  social  network  had  the  lowest  (.24), 
followed  by  the  task  network  (.56),  and  the  exchange 
network  (.70).  These  levels  estimate  the  level  of  closure 
that  maximizes the greatest amount of  guild effectiveness. 
Overall,  H1  was  supported  in  all  three  networks,  as  each 
network had a significant and negative predictor for density 
squared, suggesting a negative curvilinear pattern. 
Intergroup Brokerage 
The effects of intergroup bridging diversity were also tested 
on  guild  effectiveness.  The  task  and  exchange  networks 
included  weighted  brokerage  measures.  In  the  social 
network, intergroup bridging diversity was not significant; t 
= 1.48, p = .140.This fails to support H2 and suggests that 
guilds  that  have  greater  brokerage  with  other  guilds  may 
not be more effective than those with less brokerage in the 
social network.  
In the task network, the effect of bridging diversity on guild 
effectiveness  was  significant;  t  =  6.41,  p  <  .001.  In  the 
exchange network, bridging diversity was also significant; t 
=  8.09,  p  <  .001.  They  support  H2  for  the  task  and 
exchange network, suggesting that guilds whose characters 
trade with and play on teams with characters from a diverse 
number of other guilds are more effective.  
H2 was supported in more achievement-oriented intergroup 
networks  (task  and  exchange)  but  was  not  supported  in 
informal networks (social). 
Leadership Centrality 
The final predictor examined the effect of centrality within 
the  guild  leadership  network  by  testing  the  presence  and 
weight  of  inter-leader  connections.  Leadership  centrality 
was not significant in the social network (t = 0.33; p = .741) 
and the exchange network (t = -0.86; p = .388). This failed 
to support H3, suggesting that guilds whose leaders connect 
with  other  guild  leaders  socially  or  by  exchanging  items 
may not be a more effective guild. In the task network, the 
effect  of  leadership  centrality  weighted  by  the  number  of 
shared  inter-leader  task  interactions  was  significant;  t  = 
2.44,  p  =  .015.  This  supported  H3,  indicating  that  guilds 
with more leader task interactions may have more effective 
guilds. 
H3 was supported in the task network, but not in the social 
and  exchange  networks.  This  suggests  that  when  leaders 
team up with other leaders, the guild may be more effective 
as a whole.

SESSION: MUSEUMS AND PUBLIC SPACES

DISCUSSION 
Overall,  this  paper  suggests  that  groups  can  be  more 
effective  when  they  have  moderate  connections  between 
members across a variety of networks. Across every model 
for  all  three  networks,  team  members’  attributes  (group 
size,  group  age,  and  member  experience;  controls)  and 
intragroup  connections  (density;  H1)  were 
the  best 
predictors of team effectiveness. Other network factors (H2 
&  H3)  were  significant  depending  on  the  particular 
network.  
Of  the  team  member  attributes,  the  models  suggested  that 
large  guilds  with  experienced  members  were  the  most 
effective. In addition, teams that have been established for 
longer periods tend to have better performance. Teams were 
also  more  effective  when  their  members  connected  with 
each  other  at  a  moderate  level  (H1).  While  all  three 
networks  have  a  negative  curvilinear  relation,  it  appears 
that as the socializing aspects of the network decreases, the 
level  of  closure  at  which  performance  is  maximized 
increases. 
relatively  greater  group 
interdependence  led  to  greater  effectiveness  when  tasks 
were more achievement-oriented and were less social.  
At the same time,  when social, task, or exchange  network 
ties were too sparse or too dense, the level of achievement 
decreased  for  the  guild  as  a  whole.  Groups  that  had  low 
closure around their intragroup ties  may  have less trust or 
commitment  between  members,  and  groups  with  high 
closure  may  not  be  able  to  draw  from  or  have  access  to 
enough  diverse  information  to  help  other  teammates  to  be 
successful [5]. 
Diverse  intergroup  relations  predicted  success  only  in  the 
task  and  exchange  networks,  compared  to  the  social 
network.  These  two  networks  are  achievement-oriented, 
and  thus  connecting  with  other  characters  across  groups 
may lead to more success because of the relative experience 
that 
in  accomplishing  goals. 
However,  an  informal  social  network,  like  friendship, 
across different guilds likely does not help create successful 
teams  because  merely  knowing  people  from  other  teams 
does little to provide skills to help your own team. 
Finally,  leadership  centrality  across  teams  only  predicted 
guild effectiveness in the task network. This may be due to 
the  sparse  nature  of  leader-to-leader  connections  in  the 
social  and  exchange  networks.  Leaders  who  know  other 
leaders, however, are likely more knowledgeable about the 
game  and  thus  able  to  lead  their  own  team  to  success, 
whereas leaders knowing or trading with other people does 
little for a leadership role on their own team. 
Social Structure is Important for Group Effectiveness 
Compared 
[33]  study  on  Korean 
organizational  work  groups,  we  find  similar  results  in  a 
Chinese  MMOG  environment.  In  organizations,  members 
often have multiplex relations, developing both social- and 
task-oriented connections with the same set of individuals.

formed 

While  our  study  confirmed  Oh  et  al.’s  [33]  results  that 
social  structure  based  on  informal  ties  matter  for  group 
success,  we  also  extended  their  model  beyond  friendship. 
Our  study  showed  that  achievement-oriented  relationships 
also predicted group success in an MMOG environment.  
Comparing  these  two  results  suggests  that  group  social 
capital  processes  in  an  MMOG  may  function  in  similar 
ways to those in other organizational teams. Self-organized 
VTs,  such  as 
through  open  source 
collaboration,  may  also  benefit  from  more  research  on 
group social capital. For example, the quality of projects in 
open  source  software  development  could  increase  by 
further  developing 
social  and  achievement-oriented 
connections  to  other  users  within  the  project  or  between 
other projects. Within MMOGs, guild leaders may want to 
encourage  multiplex  social  ties  as  a  way  to  increase  trust 
within  the  group  and  to  increase  the  guild’s  access  to 
diverse external resources from other guilds.  
The  purpose  of  many  work  groups  is  to  develop  a  final 
product of quality that is greater than the sum of individual 
skills. A strength of this study is using a measure of team-
level  group  performance,  guild  points,  rather  than  an 
aggregation of individual success. At the same time, players 
in MMOGs often do not join guilds as a way to improve the 
performance  of  the  group.  Instead,  they  join  to  improve 
their own performance and advancement in the game. This 
begs  the  question:  do  individuals  benefit  from  an  ideal 
group social structure? Future research should test whether 
in  MMOGs  can  be  explained  by  a 
player  success 
combination  of 
the 
advancement  of  their  teams.  Another  is  the  use  of 
behavioral  data  to  test  group  relations  and  measure 
performance.  In  addition,  while  many  other  group  social 
capital  studies  use  survey  methods  [33,37],  we  use 
unobtrusive data of guild and character actions. 
Study Limitations and Future Research 
There are a few limitations to the research conducted in this 
paper.  First,  the  method  of  sampling  teams  and  characters 
might  affect 
the  results.  Players  can  have  multiple 
characters  interacting  with  other  guild  members,  so  some 
network  ties  may  connect  character  to  character,  but  may 
not  necessarily  connect  player  to  player.  In  addition,  only 
guilds  that  were  created  within  the  three-month  collection 
period were included for analysis, and team members might 
have  interacted  with  other  characters  from  teams  created 
before this period. The lack of these ties might dampen the 
effects  of  intergroup  brokerage,  as  guild  members  and 
leaders could be interacting with already-established guilds, 
leading to greater effectiveness after interacting with those 
guilds. Though our sample is quite large, a more-complete 
network may be necessary to test our hypotheses. 
Second, the study takes at face value the strength of the ties 
in each network. Although studies have shown that digital 
trace  data  often  reflect  actual  ties  with  confidence,  there 
may  still  be  qualitative  differences  between  the  two  [15]. 

individual  progress  and 

their 

Since  our  sample  of  networks  does  not  include  any  traces 
related  to  communication  between  each  character  in  each 
relationship, we assume the same value of each tie between 
avatars.  
Third, the study mapped the networks of formally assigned 
leaders  as  a  predictor  of  team  performance.  In  reality,  the 
“leader” with the most influence and power in a team may 
not be the same as the stated leaders. This dynamic occurs 
similarly in other kinds of  virtual teams and  work groups. 
One consideration for future research would be to compare 
and  contrast  the  intragroup  and  intergroup  networks  of 
formal leaders to the leaders who are structurally the most 
central within the team. Would the performance of the team 
be higher if the formal leader or the structurally ideal leader 
has optimal intergroup connections? 
Finally, this paper only uses the case study of one MMOG. 
Most research using game data is limited based on access, 
but  future  research  should  strive  to  do  cross-game  and 
cross-platform  comparisons,  especially  across  cultural 
divides.  For  example,  both  this  study  and  the  Oh  et  al.’s 
[33]  study  draw  participants  from  East  Asia  (China  and 
Korea).  It  is  unclear  how  much  the  findings  could  be 
attributed  to  the  unique  cultural  dimensions  of  the  study 
population, such as collectivism, long term orientation, and 
uncertainty  avoidance  [24].  At  the  same  time,  Chinese 
player  data  provides  much-needed  diversity  to  extant 
literature  on  virtual 
is 
predominantly  based  on  English-speaking  and  America-
centric  samples.  Longitudinal  data,  instead  of  snapshots, 
could also tease out subtle effects between team members. 
Other  future  research  could  adapt  and  examine  the  data 
from  non-game  virtual  teams,  look  at  other  attributes  of 
team  members  (for  example,  looking  at  homophily  and 
diversity  in  interactions  between  gender,  race,  or  age  to 
determine  if  guilds  with  similar  demographics  are  more 
effective), and further investigate the leader’s role in team 
effectiveness.  In  addition,  as  suggested  by  Assmann  et  al. 
[1], future research should also consider using MMOGs as a 
conduit to test individual and group-level social processes, 
such as longitudinal team or leadership studies. 
Mapping MMOGs 
Organizational  studies  on  MMOGs,  in  particular,  have  an 
advantage over agent-based models, in that they  have real 
people  interacting  with  the  game  and  with  other  players. 
The  behaviors  are  not  predicted,  but  can  be  instead 
measured.  This  study  uses  measured  player  behaviors  to 
“map” the optimal social structure in groups. “Mapping” is 
the  process  of  extending  “real  life”  social  dynamics  onto 
virtual worlds.  
However, because of the differences in virtual worlds, there 
are  a  few  factors  to  consider  before  mapping  real  world 
effects  onto  MMOGs.  As  suggested  by  Williams  [43], 
scholars should consider 1) group size, 2) using traditional 
controls,  3)  accounting  for  contextual  differences  in  the 
games,  and  4)  the  interactions  between  online  and  offline 

teams  and  games,  which

effects.  First,  results  from  varied  group  sizes,  anywhere 
from  the  study  of  individuals  to  entire  societies,  are  not 
interchangeable. Therefore, the results from this study, may 
not generalize to another game with a tendency for smaller 
or  larger  guilds.  Second,  the  consideration  of  individual 
differences as controls should be included. We account for 
group-level  differences  (guild  age  and  size)  and  an 
aggregate of individual differences (average  member level 
and total intragroup ties).  
Third, before mapping, contextual differences in the  game 
and  in  the  virtual  world  should  be  considered.  Players  in 
MMOGs  have  some  obvious  differences  from  other  kinds 
of  organizations,  such  as  motivations  to  participate  or 
reduced  consequences  for  risky  behavior  [43].  The 
motivations may translate to some organizational contexts, 
such  as  open  source  software  development,  where 
developers  are  motivated  by  intrinsic  factors,  such  as 
feelings  of 
community 
memberships, as well as extrinsic factors, such as possible 
future  rewards  [22].  At  the  same  time,  MMOGs  may  be 
able to be used for people to learn how to lead teams, in an 
environment  where  the  consequences  for  risky  behaviors 
are reduced [16].  
This  study’s  results  may  also  not  generalize  to  other 
organizational teams with different goals, such as routinized 
teams  or  groups  where  interdependence  is  not  crucial  to 
team success. The perceived costs and benefits in MMOGs 
can  also  be  different  from  other  contexts.  When  players’ 
characters  die,  for  example,  they  may  feel  emotional  or 
ego-centric pain, but they do not feel physical pain. 
It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  demographics  of 
MMOG  players  may  differ  from  those  of  virtual  teams  in 
general.  We  do  not  have  demographic  information  of  DN 
players.  However,  research  of  popular  MMOGs  in  the 
United States has shown that the mean age of players is in 
the  30s,  and  there  is  still  a  marked  gender  divide  [45,46]. 
The extent to which demographic profiles of gamers differ 
from those of VT participants warrants further research.     
The  final  consideration  for  mapping  MMOG  results 
addresses  the  cyclical  interactions  between  online  and 
offline  behavior.  Other  scholars,  for  example,  have  used 
MMOGs to model the spread of an infectious disease [2] or 
VT leadership effects on individual performance [16]. Here, 
we  extend  the  results  of  a  corporate  work  team  social 
structure to an online MMOG.  
Design Implications 
Guilds remain an important and valuable facet of MMOGs 
because  the  social  aspect  of  virtual  worlds  keeps  players 
engaged.  Often,  games  will  include  a  mechanism  for 
players  to  engage  with  one  another,  and  increasingly, 
MMOGs  experiment  with  different  formations  for  player 
interaction. Extending to VTs outside of MMOGs, such as 
those  in  corporations  or  in  open  source  communities,  an 
increase  in  the  opportunities  for  VT  members  to  interact

to 

impact  certain  aspects  of 

within or outside their team in different  ways  may benefit 
the overall performance of the team. 
Because  networks 
team 
performance, future VT designers might consider including 
more flexibility in the kinds of relationships allowed by the 
virtual  environment,  because  social  and  task-oriented  ties 
lead  to  differences  in  success.  Experimentation  around 
ways  to  bring  VT  members  together  in  a  new  variety  of 
relationships  (for  example,  through  mentoring,  resource 
sharing, or even direct person-to-person coordination) could 
introduce stronger ties between users, thus augmenting their 
team experiences. Making these connections  more explicit 
to  VT  members  too  will  make  them  more  aware  of  the 
social impact that teams have on their behavior. Increasing 
incentives  for  VT  members  to  make  more  ties  will  push 
them toward more beneficial relationships.  
Designers  of  virtual  environment  might  also  consider 
recommendation  systems, 
inform  users  of  other 
individuals  they  could  partner  with  to  be  maximally 
successful. In the case of MMOGs, many games currently 
expect  players  to  socialize  with  little  technical  aid,  and  if 
there are any social features, they tend to depend on offline 
friendships.  By  suggesting  pairs  or  groups  of  players  to 
each  other,  players  could  more  quickly  learn  to  grasp  the 
challenges  of  any  particular  game  space.  In  addition, 
designers could give guild leaders similar features, or extra 
communication  channels  or  in-game  benefits,  in  order  to 
share  ideas  about  guild  management  (and  thus  increasing 
team effectiveness). If players are more aware of the social 
structure  of  their  teams,  they  can  make  more  informed 
decisions about which teams to join or how to improve their 
current  team.  Future  research,  though,  could  examine  the 
relative  trade-offs  between  team  effectiveness  and  social 
enjoyment  on  impacting  player’s  engagement  with  and 
longevity  within 
the  game  world,  particularly  when 
interacting with strangers. 
CONCLUSION 
This  paper  tested  the  effects  of  social  networks  on  virtual 
teams’  performance  in  a  massively  multiplayer  online 
game. Overall, we conclude that successful teams – for any 
network  –  are  bigger,  more  experienced,  established,  and 
have  a  somewhat  moderate  level  of  closure.  As  virtual 
teams  become  more  common  and  organizations  rely  more 
often on the success of online collaborations, understanding 
both  the  actions  of  members  and  their  connections/ 
interactions within or across teams will grow in importance. 
If  groups  can  optimize  their  levels  of  group  independence 
and interdependence in both social and collaborative work, 
they  can  be  more  effective.  At  the  same  time,  when 
comparing across different types of organizations and group 
purposes,  such  as  between  MMOGs  and  organizational 
work groups, the optimal network structure may vary.
