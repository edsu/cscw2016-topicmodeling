Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA), which involves tracng people’s online behaviors, raises serious privacy coerns. We present results from a scenario-based online suey study on American and Chinese Internet users’ privacy preferences of OBA. Since privacy is context-dependent, we investigated the effects of country (US vs. China), actity (e.g., online shopping vs. online banking), and platform (desktop/laptop vs. mobile app) on people’s willingness to share their information for OBA. We found that American rpondents were signiﬁcantly less willing to share their data and had more speciﬁc concerns than their Chinese countearts. We situate these differences in the broader historical, legal, and social scenes of these countries. We also found that respondents’ OBA preferences varied signiﬁcantly across dierent online activities, suggesting the potential of contexware privacy tools for OBA. However, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of platform on people’s OBA preferences. Lastly, we discuss design implications for privacy tools.
