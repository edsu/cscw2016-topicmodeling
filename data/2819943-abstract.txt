Specific, people’s commitment to behavior change and increase their likelihood of success. However, many people struggle to create such plans, and available plans often do not fit their individual constraints. We conducted a study with 22 participants exploring the creation of personalized plans by strangers and friends to support three kinds of behavior change: diet, physical activity, and financial. In semi-structured interviews and analyses of the generated plans, we found that friends and strangers can help create behavior change plans that are actionable and help improve behavior. Participants perceived plans more positively when they were personalized to their goals, routines and preferences, or when they could foresee executing the plans with friends – often the friend who created the plan. Participants felt more comfortable sharing information with strangers and they received more diverse recommendations from strangers than friends.
