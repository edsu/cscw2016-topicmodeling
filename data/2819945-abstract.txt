Nonverbal, paralinguistic cues such as punctuation and emoticons are believed to be one of the mechanisms through which interpersonal relationship development takes place interactions. We use a novel experimental apparatus to manipulate these cues in a live Instant Message conversation. Results show a positive causal relationship of conversation duration and cue use on perceived affinity, and the relationship is contingent upon whether or not partners are able to see each other’s cues. Further analysis of the dialogue reveals that reciprocity may play a central role in supporting this effect. We then demonstrate how one’s cue use is influenced by a partner’s cue use, and show that cues are often used in greeting and sign-off rituals.
