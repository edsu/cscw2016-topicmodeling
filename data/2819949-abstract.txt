While the web contains many social websites, people are generally left in the dark about the activities of other pele traversing the web as a whole. In this paper, we explore the potential beneﬁts and privacy considerations around gerating a real-time, publicly accessible stream of web activity where users can publish chosen parts of their web browsing data. Taking inspiration from social media systems, we dcribe individual beneﬁts that can be unlocked by such shang and that may incentivize users to publish aspects of their browsing. We ask whether and how these beneﬁts outweigh potential costs in lost privacy. We conduct our study of public web activity sharing through scenario-based interviews and a ﬁeld deployment of a tool for web activity sharing.
