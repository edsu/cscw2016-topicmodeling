In online collaboration projects, conflicts often arise in the peer review process, due to the disagreement over whether one’s contribution should be accepted. These conflicts generally have detrimental effects on contributors’ continuing participation in the community. Few studies have investigated how to manage these conflicts effectively. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of three strategies – rational explanation, constructive suggestion, and social encouragement – in managing conflicts. In an analysis of 170 online software development projects, we investigated how different conflict management strategies aimed at handling contributors’ arguments during the peer review process influenced their subsequent participation in the projects. The results show that (i) conflicts significantly increase the communities; (ii) neither rational explanations nor social encouragement could reduce the negative consequences of conflicts; (iii) only constructive suggestions have a positive effect in retaining the contributors.
