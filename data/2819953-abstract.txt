Expert feedback is valuable but hard to obtain for many digners. Online crowds can provide fast and affordable feeack, but workers may lack relevant domain knowledge and experience. Can expert rubrics address this issue and help novices provide expert-level feedback? To evaluate this, we conducted an experiment with a 2×2 factorial design. Stent designers received feedback on a visual design from both experts and novices, who produced feedback using eher an expert rubric or no rubric. We found that rubrics helped novice workers provide feedback that was rated nearly as valuable as expert feedback. A follow-up analysis on wring style showed that student designers found feedback most helpful when it was emotionally positive and speciﬁc, and that a rubric increased the occurrence of these characteristics in feedback. The analysis also found that expertise correlated with longer critiques, but not the other favorable charactestics. An informal evaluation indicates that experts may itead have produced value by providing clearer justiﬁcations.
