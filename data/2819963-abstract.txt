Pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) communities on social media encourage the adoption and maintenance of disordered eang habits as acceptable alternative lifestyles rather than threats to health. In particular, the social networking site Instagram has reacted by banning searches on several prD tags and issuing content advisories on others. We prent the first large-scale quantitative study investigating pro-ED communities on Instagram in the aftermath of moration – our dataset contains 2.5M posts between 2011 and 2014. We find that the pro-ED community has adopted notandard lexical variations of moderated tags to circumvent these restrictions. In fact, increasingly complex lexical varnts have emerged over time. Communities that use lexical variants show increased participation and support of prD (15-30%). Finally, the tags associated with content on these variants express more toxic, self-harm, and vulnerable content. Despite Instagram’s moderation strategies, pro-ED communities are active and thriving. We discuss the effeiveness of content moderation as an intervention for counities of deviant behavior.
