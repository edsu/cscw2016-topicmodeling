Extracting news on speciﬁc topics from the Twitter mroblogging site poses formidable challenges, which include handling millions of tweets posted daily, judging topicality and importance of tweets, and ensuring trustworthiness of rults in the face of spam. To date, all scalable approaches have relied on crowd wisdom, i.e., keyword-matching on the global tweet stream to gather relevant tweets, and crowndorsements to judge the importance of tweets. We prose a fundamentally different methodology – for a given topic, we identify trustworthy experts on the topic, and extract news-stories that are most popular among the experts. Coaring the crowd-based and expert-based methodologies, we demonstrate that the news-stories obtained by our methology (i) have higher relevance for a wide variety of tocs, (ii) achieve very high coverage of important news-stories posted globally in Twitter, and (iii) are far more trustwohy. Using our methodology, we implemented and publicly deployed a topical news system for Twitter, which can extract news-stories on thousands of topics.
