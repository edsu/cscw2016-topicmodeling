Face-to-face social interactions among strangers today are boming increasingly rare as people turn towards computeediated networking tools. Today’s tools, however, are based on the following assumptions: increased information encouges interaction, proﬁles are good representations of users to other users, and computer-mediated communications prior to face-to-face meetings lead to better outcomes. This per describes CommonTies, a gentle technological nudge in the form of a wearable accessory, that encourages immediate, face-to-face, organic social interactions among strangers at conferences. By not exposing any proﬁle information, CoonTies preserves an element of mystery and enables selisclosure of information through conversation. We evaluate our system through a ﬁeld study at a three-day research coerence - CSCW 2014. We ﬁnd that despite our informatiocarce design, users were willing to interact with strangers and 74% of the interactions initiated by CommonTies were reported as novel and useful.
