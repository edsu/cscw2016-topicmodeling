This paper focuses on the main question whether sial media speciﬁcally conceived to enable local exchange trading schema can be adopted in diﬀerent contexts than the western digitized society, where those systems have been considered a feasible alternative to money-based capitalism. We report a qualitative study employing fus groups to study the factors which may aﬀect the adoption of these social media in Bangladesh, a deloping country that exhibits characteristics such as strong young unemployment, gender-oriented undereloyment, aging population, but also a reduced access to the service economy due to the lack of spare time. The beneﬁts of local exchange seem to be particularly ﬁtting the urban and social structure of Bangladesh.
