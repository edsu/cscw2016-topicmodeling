Social media sites have struggled with the presence of emional and physical self-injury content. Individuals who share such content are often challenged with severe mental illnesses like eating disorders. We present the ﬁrst study quantifng levels of mental illness severity (MIS) in social media. We examine a set of users on Instagram who post content on pro-eating disorder tags (26M posts from 100K users). Our novel statistical methodology combines topic modeling and novice/clinician annotations to infer MIS in a user’s coent. Alarmingly, we ﬁnd that proportion of users whose coent expresses high MIS have been on the rise since 2012 (13%/year increase). Previous MIS in a user’s content over seven months can predict future risk with ∼81% accuracy. Our model can also forecast MIS levels up to eight months in the future with performance better than baseline. We discuss the health outcomes and design implications as well as ethical considerations of this line of research.
