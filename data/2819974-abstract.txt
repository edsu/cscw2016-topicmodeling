We identify emerging phenomena of distributed liveness, iolving new relationships among performers, audiences, and technology. Liveness is a recent, technology-based construct, which refers to experiencing an event in real-time with the possibility for shared social realities. Distributed liveness entails multiple forms of physical, spatial, and social cresence between performers and audiences across physical and virtual spaces. We interviewed expert performers about how they experience liveness in physically co-present and distributed settings. Findings show that distributed perfoances and technology need to support ï¬‚exible social cresence and new methods for sensing subtle audience rponses and conveying engagement abstractly.
