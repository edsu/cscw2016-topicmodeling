When personalities clash, teams operate less effectively. Peonality differences affect face-to-face collaboration and may lower trust in virtual teams. For relatively short-lived assigents, like those of online crowdsourcing, personality matcng could provide a simple, scalable strategy for effective team formation. However, it is not clear how (or if) persolity differences affect teamwork in this novel context where the workforce is more transient and diverse. This study emines how personality compatibility in crowd teams affects performance and individual perceptions. Using the DISC peonality test, we composed 14 ﬁve-person teams (N=70) with either a harmonious coverage of personalities (balanced) or a surplus of leader-type personalities (imbalanced). Results show that balancing for personality leads to signiﬁcantly beer performance on a collaborative task. Balanced teams eibited less conﬂict and their members reported higher lels of satisfaction and acceptance. This work demonstrates a simple personality matching strategy for forming more effeive teams in crowdsourcing contexts.
