In  most  sociotechnical  systems,  individuals  are  tracked 
through  user  accounts.  This  paper  explores  the  various 
ways  in  which  people  create  and  use  multiple  user 
representations, specifically in online games. Using 8 years 
of population data from a popular multiplayer online game, 
EVE  Online,  we  examine  how  multiple  character  creation 
and  use  occurs  at  scale  and  how  operationalization  of 
individuals  between  accounts  and  characters 
impacts 
methods.  We  suggest  that  conceptualizing  participants  in 
online  games  based  on  the  assumption  that  one  character 
equals  one  individual  can  lead  to  incorrect  analyses 
regarding the demographics or behaviors of the population. 
Additionally,  social  network  analysis  suggests  that  a 
character-centric,  rather  than  account-level,  viewpoint  can 
change  the  results  of  statistical  relationships  with  network 
metrics such as eigenvector centrality.

In most sociotechnical systems, an individual must create a 
user  account 
the 
technology  industry  – and  even  occasionally  academia  – 
accept  that  trace  data  tied  to  one  account  represents  the 
holistic  experience  of  one  individual.  Especially  as  more 
and  more  systems  track  people’s  metadata,  engineers  and 
researchers  continue  to  adopt  user  profiling  and  other 
aggregated  empirical 
to  more  accurately 
techniques 
reconstruct individual’s experiences. 
However,  some  individuals  that  participate  in  online 
systems  decide 
to  create  multiple  representations  of 
themselves  by  generating  more  than  one  user  account.  In 
the  literature,  this  practice  is  known  as  multiple  profile 
maintenance,  and  we  call  the  implementation  of  user 
identification  in  sociotechnical  systems  “technical  user 
representation.”  These  representations  are  then  used  for  a 
variety  of  reasons,  though  usually  each  is  set  aside  for  a

distinct  purpose.  For  instance,  one  person  may  create  a 
more-private personal Twitter account to share updates with 
friends  while  maintaining  another  public,  work-specific 
account. While some research has been conducted on why 
people separate these traces across multiple accounts, little 
research  has  empirically  examined  how  people  separate 
these accounts. 
Studying how people use multiple technical representations 
is important for understanding identity practices, but these 
uses  also  have  important  implications  for  social  science 
methodologies  and  theories.  If  people  create  multiple 
representations of themselves, researchers should be aware 
of how these practices might impact their interpretation of 
trace data.  
Games  constitute  one  approach  to  understanding  the 
behaviors  of  separating  experiences  across  different 
technical  user  representations.  Players  can  create  multiple 
avatars  and  interact  with  the  game  environment  or  other 
players  in  varied  ways,  generating  different  sets  of  trace 
data  across  these  virtual  characters.  Frequently,  games 
catalogue  each  avatar  under  one  account  per  individual, 
uniting the characters under a common login, even though 
they  represent  distinct  personae 
the  game  world 
(especially since the player often cannot use more than one 
character at the same time).  
Our  motivation  is  to  understand  how  the  two  different 
representations  of  a  person  within  a  game  world  (account 
and  character)  impact  our  understanding  of  behaviors  in 
sociotechnical  systems.  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  two 
research questions, the first informing the second: 
RQ1:  How  do  players  use  multiple  characters,  and  do 
players create similar experiences (and trace data) across 
multiple characters?  
RQ2: When players use multiple characters, how do these 
uses  affect  analyses  of  trace  data  and  interpretation  of 
behaviors?  
In  this  paper,  we  use  the  case  study  of  one  massively 
multiplayer  online  game  (MMOG)  to  study  multiple 
character  use.  First,  we  survey  the  literature  on  multiple 
account  use;  in  particular,  we  analyze  the  current  game 
literature’s  approach  to  multiple  character  use.  We  then 
examine  the  entire  population  of  players  using  a  dataset 
comprising  over  8  years  of  server  logs  since  the  game’s

launch.  In  this  data,  we  look  at  the  adoption  rates  of 
multiple characters by players of different demographics in 
relation to their relative gameplay experiences. Using these 
empirical  insights,  we  then  analyze  how  trace  data  from 
multiple technical representations impacts research methods 
for  interpreting  sociotechnical  behaviors.  We  specifically 
look  at  social  network  structures  and  how  account  and 
character  perspectives  differ.  We  conclude  with  a 
discussion of the impact that using character- and account- 
level  data  may  have  on  the  theoretical  interpretation  of 
individuals’ behaviors in sociotechnical systems.  
(cid:19)(cid:10)(cid:14)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:1)(cid:24)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:13)(cid:1)
Systems  for  defining  users  –  be  it  through  usernames, 
account  numbers,  or  other  means  –  exist  in  almost  every 
sociotechnical system. Many scholars have challenged how 
technologists envision and construct “the user” (for a proper 
overview, see  [27].) Still, these critiques go a step beyond 
the  basic  implementation  and  applications  of  technical 
systems  and  models  for  user  identification  [1]  which  by 
themselves remain complicated. It is not just a question of 
who the user could be [25] but how the user is defined at a 
technical  level.  Individuals  can  create  one  or  multiple 
accounts,  these  accounts  can  be  frequently  or  rarely  used, 
and  some  accounts  can  even  be  spoofed  to  appear  like 
individuals (e.g., via social media bots or online MMORPG 
gold  farmers 
[20]).  Yet  we  still  rely  on  knowing 
“individuals” through these technical representations.  
(cid:15)(cid:41)(cid:33)(cid:40)(cid:32)(cid:37)(cid:33)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:18)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:30)(cid:32)(cid:33)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:32)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:29)(cid:35)(cid:26)(cid:35)(cid:27)(cid:29)(cid:1)
When individuals in sociotechnical systems split their lived 
experience  across  multiple  accounts,  this  is  known  as 
multiple  profile  maintenance  (MPM).  MPM  suggests  that 
people  create  alternate 
technical  profiles  because  of 
boundary regulation and privacy management.  
The ability for one person to create multiple representations 
complicate 
account 
representations.  Many  types  of  decisions  result  in  the 
creation and maintenance of multiple profiles, especially for 
communication technologies. Gross’s study [12] of multiple 
email  accounts  illustrates  how  users  exhibited  a  range  of 
motivations,  from  wanting  a  variety  of  usernames  to 
separating spheres of daily life (e.g., family, friends, work, 
etc.).  Stutzman  &  Hartzog  [36]  find  similar  decisions  in 
studying individuals’ MPM on the same social network site: 
privacy remained the primary concern, followed by identity 
management,  utility  of  separated  accounts  (to  coordinate 
activities), and adherence to social norms. Leavitt  [21] has 
also  shown  that  people  will  adopt  additional  temporary 
accounts to share momentary information that they do not 
want linked to their primary account.  
(cid:45)(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:32)(cid:35)(cid:46)(cid:1)(cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:4)(cid:1)(cid:45)(cid:6)(cid:33)(cid:40)(cid:46)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:31)(cid:26)(cid:38)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:40)(cid:29)(cid:38)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:32)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:32)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:36)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:26)(cid:34)(cid:29)(cid:39)(cid:1)
Online video games provide another context for the creation 
of  multiple  “profiles.”  While  communication  technologies 
are  frequently  used  for  personal  communication,  video 
games represent another domain of technical representation, 
founded  in  entertainment  experiences.  Because  games  can

is  also  a  social  factor 

revolve  around  achievement,  players  may  also  use  game 
profiles to boast about their accomplishments in addition to 
self-presentation (e.g., through avatars). While these players 
will  not  necessarily  create  multiple  technical  usernames  – 
because it is difficult to sign in and out of game interfaces, 
and occasionally you may need to set up separate financial 
information on each account – they may generate multiple 
characters to experience different parts of a game in varying 
ways (for example, to see what kind of persona or role they 
wish to take on in the game world).  
In  game  parlance  and  in  the  literature,  the  most-played 
character  is  dubbed  the  “main”  while  any  additional 
characters are known as “alts” (for “alternative” characters). 
The  context  of  games 
therefore  provides  different 
motivations  for  creating  distinct  and  separate  character 
representations.  
Ducheneaut and Moore [9] present a qualitative framework 
for  thinking  about  main  and  alt  characters.  Some  games 
provide  robust  and  diverse  character  customization,  while 
others restrict the player to only a few preset options. While 
players  may  choose  a  range  of  characters  to  play  and 
maintain  over  time  to  explore  different  parts  of  the  game, 
character  creation 
in  online 
multiplayer  gameplay,  as  people  need  to  form  balanced 
groups  to  progress  through  certain  areas.  As  the  authors 
point out, though, switching between characters introduces 
some difficulties: if the alt character is far away at another 
location  in  the  game  world,  smooth  transitions  between 
characters,  in  order  to  maintain  social  balance  in  a  group, 
can be cumbersome.  
Furthermore,  because  characters  can  be  customized,  some 
players  connect  with  them  on  a  personal  level  (see,  for 
example, Hitchens, Drachen, and Richards [13]). Williams, 
Kennedy,  and  Moore  [43]  also  note  that  players  adapt 
certain  characters 
through 
roleplaying: one desire in using certain characters noted by 
players 
interviews  revolves  around  “construct[ing] 
character  histories  and  fantasies,"  meaning  that  players 
could  create  multiple  characters 
to  explore  different 
experiences  within  the  game  world.  Poor  and  Skoric  [29] 
illustrate cases of particular guilds where individual players 
actually housed multiple characters (“The 1,026 characters 
were spread over 550 user accounts, for 1.86 characters in 
the  guild  per  account,  but  this  is  most  likely  a  long-tail 
situation,  where  some  players  were  heavily  invested  in 
[guild  #1]  across  multiple  characters  and  some  players 
casually made a character and found a guild to join. [Guild 
#2] had 42 characters and was more focused, with only 16 
user  accounts,  for  an  average  of  2.6  characters  per 
account...”).  
Additionally, the authors note that reputation plays a large 
role  in  alt  character  use.  Because  on  a  technical  level 
creating  an  alt  character  results  in  restarting  in  the  game 
world,  newer  characters  are  not  tied  to  older,  more 
advanced ones: for some players, this results in a loss of in-

in  devious  or  detrimental  ways, 

game  status.  In  the  past  decade,  multiplayer  games  – 
especially  competitive  ones  – have  suffered  because 
advanced players will create new accounts, or “smurfs,” to 
easily  beat  newbies  under  the  guise  of  inexperience. 
Williams, Kennedy, & Moore [43] note that main characters 
also  define  reputation  not  just  in  terms  of  accumulated 
statistics  but  also  position  in  a  game  ecosystem:  because 
main characters tend to be the representations with the most 
minutes, this avatar tends to determine the server on which 
the player’s set of characters resides. Other issues with alts 
revolve  around  griefing  and  trolling,  where  players  will 
create  alternative  representations  of  themselves  to  interact 
with  others 
taking 
advantage of reputation (or lack thereof) to mess up others’ 
experiences [3]. Consalvo [7] points out that alts introduce 
anonymity  and  complicate  reputation;  however,  some 
games have shaped alt use with functional mechanisms, for 
instance allowing friends to identify each others’ alts or in 
some cases limiting what people can do with them because 
they cost additional subscription money to use. 
Demographics can play a role in character representations. 
Men  and  women  may  exhibit  differences  in  character 
creation, due to different in-game motivations (like combat 
or  roleplay),  financial  situations,  maintaining  anonymity, 
etc.  [22,40].  As  an  example,  female  players  often  find 
themselves  facing  harassment  or  other  cultural  barriers 
within  predominantly  male  games  [10].  As  a  result  there 
may  be  an  incentive  to  avoid  "feminine"  behaviors  or 
avatars in some online games in order to circumvent these 
issues  [31].  Second,  players  from  different  locations  may 
differ in character creation. Players may approach exploring 
a  game  differently  depending  on  the  geographical  and 
cultural  context  of  play  outside  and  inside  the  game. 
Frequently, players from different geographies are placed in 
different servers (a process known as sharding), in order to 
preserve  quality  play  and  reduce  lag.  However,  cross-
cultural  interactions  can  produce  tensions  [37].  Finally, 
players  from  different  age  groups  may  differ  in  character 
creation.  Younger  players  tend  to  have  more  free  time  to 
play,  though  older  players  may  have  more  financial 
resources  to  spend  on  games.  Styles  of  gameplay  also 
change  as  players  age,  with  older  participants  generally 
drifting  away  from  violent  elements  of  the  game  towards 
more  strategic  parts  of  the  overall  experience  [11].  These 
contexts lead us to hypothesize: 
H1. Players that are male will create more characters. 
H2.  Players  that  are  from  English-speaking  countries  will 
create more characters. 
H3. Players that are younger will create more characters. 
The  creation  of  a  character  –  or  even  switching  between 
multiple characters – may also depend heavily on technical 
and social entry and exit costs [14]. Communities depend on 
high entry costs to gate the admittance of new members and 
maintain  order  through  social  norms,  and  members  of 

650

communities  face  exit  costs  by  losing  access  to  the 
resources  and  social  connections  of  the  group.  Games 
involve  similar  costs  in  that  new  players  must  learn  the 
norms  of  the  player  ecosystem,  and  older  players  – by 
creating new characters – potentially lose out on markers of 
reputation,  accumulated  resources,  and  coded  connections 
to other players and groups. The game mechanics and code 
of particular games may also affect decisions around costs: 
for  example,  some  games  only  allow  a  set  number  of 
character  slots  to  be  filled,  and  older  characters  must  be 
deleted to create new ones. Many games also have imposed 
limitations  on  how  far  players  can  progress,  so  restarting 
the  game  with  new  characters  is  a  way  to  continue 
exploring  the  game  world  without  encountering  boredom 
through  non-progression  at  the  highest  achievable  levels, 
though again this introduces a potential loss of reputation. 
Social  activities  in  games  may  also  relate  to  character 
creation. When players interact in team and guild settings, 
they sometimes coordinate with each other to create certain 
characters that will fulfill tasks and goals. Players’ positions 
in  a  social  network  may  also  relate  to  the  amount  of 
characters they create, as they become more involved with 
influential  and  well-connected  people  [30,32].  These 
contexts lead us to hypothesize: 
H4.  Accounts  that  are  well  connected  to  other  well-
connected  accounts  (have  higher  eigenvector  centrality) 
will create more characters. 
(cid:9)(cid:32)(cid:24)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:31)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:30)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:18)(cid:31)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:17)(cid:30)(cid:1)
While  the  use  of  main  and  alt  characters  in  video  games 
revolves  around  many  gameplay  experiences,  it  also 
becomes a confound in conducting game research.  
Some  research  uses  alts  for  context  and  triangulation  in 
understanding  player  motivations  and  experiences.  For 
example, Nardi and Harris [26] use alts as a method in their 
ethnographic 
the  variety  of 
individuals’  game  experiences  in  World  of  Warcraft 
(Ducheneaut et al. [9] uses a similar approach). Focusing on 
the  role  of  collaborative  social  in  WoW,  they  note  that 
some  players  that  pursued  this  trajectory  in  the  game  felt 
that playing at the highest-achievable level was not as fun 
as  surveying  the  diverse  range  of  characters  and  their 
respective  classes,  roles,  and  lore,  even  if  it  meant 
essentially starting from scratch. Some players even found 
pleasure in creating new characters and helping other new 
players that they encountered, drawing from their previous 
experiences. 
More  recently,  as  game  research  adapts  trace  data  for 
various  analyses  [41]  the  question  of  multiple  characters 
grows  into  a  larger  issue  of  interpretation:  namely,  if  the 
translation  of  one  character  equals  one  human.  This  is 
especially  problematic  when  researchers  use  games  as 
proxies  for  general  human  behavior  [10].  While  alt 
characters  play  an  important  role  in  the  exploratory  and 
social  experiences  of  online  video  games,  they  also 
introduce complications in research about understanding

mediated experiences. As Nardi and Harris [26] note, “[I]t is 
common to have alts which the logging [of social ties in a 
research study] cannot account for. Because of alts, offline 
friends  may  still  play  together,  providing  a  highly  social 
experience.  We  had  several  such  cases  among  our 
informants. Friends at different levels continue to chat. And 
a lower level player may request advice or assistance from a 
higher level friend.” Wood et al. [44] note that players can 

651

have multiple alts, but in their discussion of methodological 
issues in online game research, they do not actually discuss 
mapping multiple alts to individual players as a problem. 
Sampling  of  characters  can  duplicate  individuals  by  using 
more than one of that player’s characters. It is also unclear 
on  an  empirical  level  how  often  and  how  much  alt 
characters  are  played  and  how  much  they  would  skew 
distributions of gameplay data. Notably, Williams et al. [42] 
remark, after using only one character per player (or most 
recent  characters  if  multiple  characters  were  used  often), 
that: 

This  [decision]  highlights  the  need  for  better  controls  when 
considering low-centrality players. A metric reflecting a player’s 
centrality  over  a  longer  period  of  time  for  example  would  have 
been  particularly  useful.  Also  problematic  was  the  confound  of 
main  versus  alt  characters.  Most  WoW  players  have  multiple 
characters even when they primarily play only one. Yet these alts 
were  counted  as  equivalent  in  our  initial  player  census  efforts. 
Their mere presence helped establish cut-points for what a high- 
or low-centrality player is. So, although we are confident that our 
high-centrality players are high because we set a high numerical 
floor for them, we are hesitant to offer strong conclusions about 
the roles and habits of low-centrality players. 

in  different 

To  test  whether  accounts  and  characters  impact  social 
networks, we also hypothesize: 
H5.  Account-level  networks  will  result 
statistical coefficients than character-level networks. 
Furthermore,  statistical  analyses  employing  character  data 
might not necessarily account for the personal limitations of 
playing multiple characters (e.g., having to play one at the 
expense  of  another).  While  some  peer-reviewed  research 
accounts  for  multiple  characters,  not  all  publications  do, 
and  sometimes  it  is  difficult  to  even  parse  if,  and  which, 
characters belong to which players. For instance, Williams 
et al. [42] use only one main character per player, because 
they  admit  that  they  “were  not  able  to  separate  real-life 
players from the multiple characters they played” (344).  
In  Table  1,  we  present  a  summary  of  how  research  that

technical  representation  use.  Therefore,  in  the  rest  of  this

popular  multiplayer  game.  From  this  foundation,  we  then 
show how the distinction between accounts and characters 
impact  methods  for  studying  social  interactions  in  these 
types  of  games,  using  social  networks  as  a  point  of 
comparison.  Afterward,  we  conclude  with  a  discussion  of 
these  differences  on  our  theoretical  understanding  of 
multiple technical representations.

This  paper  uses  the  case  study  of  EVE  Online,  a  massive 
multiplayer online game. EVE was created by CCP Games 
and launched in 2003; as of early 2013, the game boasts of 
500,000 dedicated, paying subscriptions.1 
EVE  is  a  space-based  MMORPG,  where  players  pilot  a 
character through various galaxies, encountering numerous 
worlds and thousands of other players. The game provides 
the  choice  of  creating  a  detailed  custom  avatar  in  one  of 
four unique “races”: Gallente, Amarr, Caldari, or Minmatar. 
Unlike other MMORPGs, where the player must spend time 
exploring  the  world  and  attacking  enemies  to  level  up 
(“grinding”),  EVE  allows  players  to  select  one  skill  every 
24  hours  and  set  a  countdown  timer  to  train  on  that  skill 
(though  the  account  must  have  at  that  point  paid  for  an 
account  subscription).  Players  explore  the  world  as  their 
skills progress. However, you can only be logged into one 
character  at  a  time,  and  to  train  the  skills  of  multiple 
characters  at  the  same  time,  you  must  pay  additional  in-
game  or  real  currency  (or  create  another  account  with  an 
entirely  separate  character).2 The  game  is  notorious  for  its 
initial  difficulty:  many  video  game  players  have  left  the 
game after a few days because of its steep learning curve. 
Also, EVE also runs on a single server. Unlike over games, 
where players are usually separated by geographic location 
to reduce server load, all characters inhabit the same game 
world and have the potential to interact with each other.

first,  we 

For  this  paper,  we  analyzed  a  dataset  of  game  server  logs 
from  EVE  Online,  collected  and  provided  by  CCP.  The 
dataset  spans  over  8  years  of  server  logs,  from  May  06, 
2003 
to  July  06,  2011.  The  dataset  represents  an 
anonymized  population  of  EVE  players,  along  with 
demographic  data  (gender,  age,  location)  and  aggregated 
gameplay data (active account [Y/N], minutes played, skill 
points earned, teams joined, etc.), in addition to a snapshot 
of the character friendship (directed edge) network taken on 
the  last  day  of  the  collection  period.  In  total,  we  look  at 
5,391,685 players accounts that created an account to play 
the  game  at  some  point,  as  well  as  10,110,558  characters 
created by individuals using those accounts.  
This paper presents a holistic account of players and their 
characters,  though  some  data  cleaning  occurred.  To  bin 
accounts  into  clusters,  we  removed  outliers  based  on 
excessive  minutes  played  or  number  of  friends  in  the 
network. 
(cid:6)(cid:16)(cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:1)
Our analysis of the EVE player population is split into two 
sections: 
look  at  comparisons  of  player 
demographics from all characters. This examination sets an 
empirical baseline for multiple technical representations at 
scale.  Then,  we  look  at  a  sample  of  active  players  to 
compare their demographics, gameplay statistics, and social 
network  connections,  showing  how  methods  should  deal 
with  account-  and  character-level  differences  for  players 
who use multiple representations.

First, we present descriptive statistics of all player accounts, 
shown in Table 2.  
Players  may  create  as  many  characters  as  they  want,  but 
EVE restricts accounts from keeping more than 3 characters 
active. Players may delete prior characters in order to create 
new ones. The mean number of characters created is 1.875, 
and  the  highest  number  of  total  characters  created  by  any 
one  account  in  our  dataset  is  407.  The  number  of  players 
with N characters follows a long-tail distribution: there are 
3,485,807 accounts with only 1 character, 879,636 accounts 
with  2  characters  created,  and  521,560  accounts  with  3 
characters created. There are still 193,340 accounts that had 
created 4 characters (meaning they had deleted one to open 
up  a  character  slot).  64.65%  of  accounts  created  only  1 
character compared to 35.35% that created more than one. 
When players sign up for EVE and create an account, they 
are  asked  basic  demographic  information,  like,  gender, 
location, and date of birth. Like other MMOGs, the gender 
skews  toward  male,  but  there  are  only  about  5%  self-
reported female accounts.  
EVE  boasts  a  single  server  on  which  all  players  reside; 
while the most accounts identify as residing in the United 
States  (1,834,541,  or  34%),  the  top  ten  countries  also 
include  the  United  Kingdom  (515,655),  Russia  (422,810), 
Germany    (371,582),  Canada  (267,670),  China  (254,998), 

SESSION: MUSEUMS AND PUBLIC SPACES

France  (134,565),  Australia  (128,370),  Sweden  (122,459), 
and the Netherlands (98,395). A number of teams in EVE 
draw  players  from  similar  geographies  and  languages,  but 
the major language of the game remains English. Based on 
these self-reported locations, we coded the major English-
language  countries  (United  States,  United  Kingdom, 
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) to compare English-
language accounts’ practices in character creation.  
Calculating players’ ages is complicated. When players sign 
up for an account on EVE, they are asked to input their date 
of  birth.  However,  the  form  presents  the  year  1978  as  the 
default  year.  A  significant  portion  of  accounts  input  their 
year  as  1978,  meaning  that  these  accounts  may  be 
inaccurate  as  far  as  reporting  the  age  of  the  player. 
Therefore,  we  separated  any  account  with  1978  in  the 
analysis.  Accounts  that  input  1978  as  their  year  of  birth 
may  be  an  artifact  of  accounts  that  were  created  quickly 
with no intention of playing (and therefore there may be a 
correlation  with  the  default  birth  year  with  one-character 
accounts).  
(cid:6)(cid:27)(cid:40)(cid:32)(cid:42)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:27)(cid:27)(cid:36)(cid:41)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:31)(cid:26)(cid:38)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:40)(cid:29)(cid:38)(cid:1)(cid:21)(cid:38)(cid:32)(cid:26)(cid:28)(cid:39)(cid:1)
While some studies have examined alt use qualitatively, no 
studies  have  looked  at  alts  at  scale.  More  importantly, 
comparison  across  alt  characters  has  not  been  conducted. 
Below,  we  look  at  accounts  that  have  created  multiple 
characters,  in  particular  accounts  with  three  characters,  to 
look  at  how  demographics 
to  show 
comparisons across characters. 
Active accounts are any that pay to sign in to the game at 
the time of the dataset snapshot. Amongst active accounts 
with characters in active character slots, there were 156863 
accounts  with  1  character,  123899  accounts  with  2 
characters,  and  132228  accounts  with  3  characters.  Our 
regressions and network comparisons draw from all active 
accounts  and  characters,  but  to  compare  trace  data  across 
characters,  we  specifically  focus  on  comparisons  of 
accounts with 3 active characters.  
In EVE, players are able to hold active characters in three 
slots and any previously-created characters must be deleted 
to make room for new ones. Players can delete characters, 
but they will be marked as not active, and therefore are not 
included in this analysis. Characters that remain in an active 
slot, even with 0 minutes played, are still considered active 
characters. Characters also are tagged with a character rank, 
or the relative order in which the character was created on 
the  account.  To  combine  these  concepts  of  activity  and 
rank,  consider  an  account  that  created  5  characters  in  its 
lifetime.  If  this  account  deleted  the  second  and  third 
characters, the active characters for this account would be 
first, fourth, and fifth.

For  context  about  character  creation  in  relation  to  active 
character  use,  in  Table  3,  we  show  which  characters  in 
order  of  creation  per  account  (based  on  the  top  15 
combinations) have been held in the top 3 ranked character 
slots (by most minutes played). Overall, the first 3 created 
characters  are  the  most  played,  and  even  more  the  first 
character created tends to be the most played overall. Only 
until  the  10th  combination  of  characters  do  we  see  a  4th 
character appear (meaning that one character at some point 
was deleted that had fewer minutes than the 4th).

Earlier, we presented descriptive statistics showing for each 
account  in  the  game  the  self-reported  demographics  of 
players.  To 
those 
demographics,  we  ran  a  negative  binomial  regression  to 
predict  the  count  of  characters  created  by  active  player 
accounts. We relate account gender, country language, and 
age to each other, controlling for minutes played total and 
number of friends total for all characters on the account. 
In  Table  5,  we  show 
incident  rate  ratio  (or 
exponentiated  beta;  with  standard  error  in  parentheses). 
These results support all three of our hypotheses (H1-H3). 
The  model  demonstrates  that  creating  more  characters  is 
significantly related to (H1) being male (exp(β) = 1.127, or 
1.127 times more likely per increase in # characters), (H2) 
being from an English-language country (exp(β) = 0.979, or 
0.979 times less likely to be non-English per increase in # 
characters),  and  (H3)  being  a  younger  player  (exp(β)  = 

the 

0.840,  or  0.840  less  likely  to  be  the  default  1978  when 
compared  to  24  and  Under).  Further,  creating  more 
characters  was  significantly  related  to  our  controls:  more 
minutes played and more friend connections made (though 
the coefficients for these variables were very small).  
(cid:6)(cid:27)(cid:25)(cid:28)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:20)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:15)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:15)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:16)(cid:29)(cid:27)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:31)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:30)(cid:18)(cid:1)
To look at the differences across gameplay experiences, we 
first bin accounts by character use.3 We use active accounts 
that  have  three  active  character  slots  filled.  Ordering  each 
character  by  the  total  number  of  minutes  played  per 
account,  we  employ  unsupervised  k-means  clustering  to 
separate player accounts into k=5 clusters based on the total 
number  of  minutes  played  per  character4.  This  technique 
resulted 
in  an  automatic  separation,  based  on 
the 
relationship  across  characters,  between  accounts 
that 
primarily play with 1 character (in low, medium, and high 
amounts),  accounts  that  mainly  use  2  characters,  and 
accounts that use 3 characters. The distribution of accounts 
in  each  of  these  clusters  is  presented  in  Figure  1  below. 
This allows us to break all active accounts into five binned 
groups for further analysis. 
(cid:13)(cid:22)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:18)(cid:30)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:1)
The  k-means  algorithm  separated  each  of  the  five  clusters 
based  on  minutes  per  active  character.  In  Figure  2,  we 
illustrate  the  breakdown  per  character  of  minutes  played 
based on these clusters. As we described above, we see the 
breakdown  of  the  clusters  illustrated:  one  group  of  low 
engagement accounts, two groups with accounts that focus 
on  one  character  (medium  and  high  minutes  of  play, 
respectively), one group that focuses on two characters, and 
a final group that focuses on three characters.  
Next,  we  examine  accumulated  skill  points.  In  EVE, 
players can train particular skills of their characters in order 
to  progress  further  through  various  parts  of  the  game. 
Unlike  other  MMORPGs,  players  in  EVE  do  not  attack 
enemies  to  level  up.  Instead,  they  activate  a  timed 
countdown. Players can walk away from this “training” and 
even  shut  down  their  computer  while  the  countdown 
progresses.  However,  only  one  character  per  account  may 
train  a  skill  at  a  time  (unless  the  user  pays  money  to  do 
more).  Still,  higher  numbers  of  skill  points  act  as  another 
marker  of  dedication  to  a  particular  character.  We  show 
total skill points per character per cluster in Figure 3. 

3 Using  accounts  with  three  created  active  characters  allows  us  to  more-
easily  compare  across  character  trace  data.  We  recognize  that  accounts 
with  two  characters  could  be  compared  as  well,  but  accounts  with  three 
active character slots illustrate a good range of single, double, and triple 
character use cases.  
4 Five  clusters  were  chosen  based  on  the  results  of  calculating  principal
components in a scree plot.

Avatars play an important role in MMORPGs, because they 
are  the  visual  representation  of  the  player  in  the  game 
world.  Most  modern 
advanced 
customization of avatar design and fashion, and avatars do 
not  need 
to  out-of-game  human 
characteristics.  Therefore,  different  avatar  designs  across 
multiple  characters  may  act  as  a  marker  of  exploration  of 
different facets of a game. We compare multiple characters 
regarding differing in-game character design. 
While  most  games  tend  to  revolve  around  male  or  female 
avatars,  players  do  swap  the  gender  of  their  characters 
compared to the gender of themselves. Research has shown 
that  men  tend  to  change  avatar  gender  more  than  women 
[19]  though  both  sides  exhibit  this  behavior  to  a  small 
degree.  In  Figure  4  and  Table  6,  we  show  how  character 
gender changes across multiple characters. For each cluster, 
and  for  all  character  pairs, we  see  that  most  of  the  time 
players will stick with the same character gender.

Table 7. Most common permutations of character race. 

Character  race  is  another  mechanic  through  which  players 
can  explore  different  aspects  of  the  game  world.  Unlike 
gender, in MMORPGs a character’s race, lineage, and other 
sociocultural  attributes  tend  to  be  more  diverse  and 
imaginative.  Frequently,  game  designers  will 
link  a 
character  trait  like  race  to  different  or  at  least  varied 
gameplay  styles.  This  is  the  case  in  EVE,  where  different 
races lead to different classes of ships and other gameplay 
content. In Figure 5 and Table 7, we explore how character 
race  changes  across  multiple  characters.  For  each  cluster, 
and  for  all  character  pairs, we  see  that  most  of  the  time 
players will alter their character’s race.

In many multiplayer online games, players are given ways 
to express connections to friends, enemies, and teammates.  
Guilds  and  social  networks  can  be  constructed  as 
representations  of  these  relationships.  Teams  are  frequent 
occurrences in online multiplayer games, because they help 
retain  players  while  also  adding  additional  limitations  to 
progression  (namely  that  you  need  to  work  with  other 
people to beat difficult areas). Games also help players

connect  with  each  other,  through  in-game  chat,  trade, 
combat, and other mechanisms for marking social relations. 
In  EVE,  players  may  create  their  own  guilds  called 
"corporations."  Corporations  allow  teammates  to  work 
together  to  collect  resources  and  fight  other  teams  in 
combat.  To  look  at  guilds,  we  take  each  character  per 
account in each of the five clusters and compare at the time 
of the snapshot if each pair of characters was in the same 
guild,  a  different  guild,  or  no  guild.  The  results  are 
presented in Figure 6. Overall, the data shows that as more 
characters are used, the placement in the same guild occurs 
more frequently across all three characters. Also, as fewer 
characters  are  used,  the  chance  of  one  of  those  characters 
not being in any player-created guild increases.

In-game  interactions,  such  as  chatting  with  one  another, 
trading  items  between  players,  or  even  sharing  private 
living  quarters  can  also  connect  players 
in  similar 
networked  relationships.  Though  little  research  has  been 
conducted  on  players’  motivations  to  create  (or  to  refuse 
making) traces of connections between acquaintances, both 
offline and in-game social networks greatly impact the way 
that  players  experience  games  [33].  Therefore, 
these 
networks have been used as markers of social connections 
and proxies for social value (like social capital) [35].  
Since social networks can represent an important part of the 
player  experience,  one  question  we  ask  is  how  much  do 
players  replicate  social  connections  across  their  multiple 
characters.  Do  players  keep  their  alts  close,  or  do  they 
explore  far  reaches  of  the  game  world  using  distinct  and 
separate trajectories? 
First, we look at how many friends an account’s characters 
possess; these numbers are presented in Figure 7. Just like 
with minutes and skill points, we see a similar distribution 
of friendship numbers: for one-character accounts, the other 
two  characters  do  not  have  many  friendships  with  other 
players,  while  for  two-  and  three-character  accounts, 
friendship connections are made more frequently on the alt 
characters.  Also,  we  again  see  accounts  that  are  highly 
active  with  one  character  generally  creating  more 
friendships  than  the  two-  and  three-character  accounts, 
which fits with the results of our earlier regression.  
Keeping these differences in mind, to examine the way in 
which  characters  are  connected  to  each  other  in  the 
friendship  network,  we  created  a  large  social  network 
graph, where characters are nodes and edges are friendship 
connections.  These  friendship  connections  were  any 
friendships  established  at  the  time  of  the  data  collection 
snapshot. For characters with no friendship connections, we 
include them in the graph as unconnected isolates. In total, 
there  are  801,346  nodes  (222,837  of  which  are  isolates) 
with  6,453,627 edges.  

In order to examine how characters are relatively connected 
in the social network, we look at "path distance" as a metric 
of  closeness  within  the  network.  The  path  in  a  network 
graph is the number of edges between two nodes, and path 
distance generally describes how "far apart" two nodes are 
in a network. If nodes are well-connected, the path distance 
will  be  lower;  if  path  distance  is  high,  nodes  are  less 
connected (and may suffer from issues like structural holes 
[26]). If the user's characters are not connected within the 
social  graph  they  are  assigned  a  distance  of  infinity.  In 
general players pursue a mixed strategy, forming closed and 
tightly  knit  groups  with  trusted  companions  but  still 
reaching out and forming new relationships as a source of 
novelty  or  information  [34];  however,  it  is  unclear  how 
multiple character use affects social network structure.  
We illustrate path distance in the EVE friendship network 
in  Figure  8.  Generally,  for  accounts  that  focus  on  one 
character,  we  see  high  rates  of  unconnectedness  (mainly 
due to the fact that many of the alt characters have few to 
no  friendship  connections,  or  if  they  do,  they  are  likely 
isolated  from  the  primary  network  component).  The  path 
length  occurrences  increase  for  two-  and  three-  character 
accounts.  More  importantly,  though,  for  those  characters 
that  are  connected,  we  tend  to  see  an  account's  characters 
connected at path distances less than 3. A path length of 1 
means that characters are direct friends; a path distance of 2 
means they are connected indirectly, by one other character. 
Surprisingly, the results show a high rate of path distance 2, 
particularly  for  the  second-to-third  character  pairing.  This 
means  that  instead  of  a  well-connected  triad  between  all 
three  of  an  account's  characters,  we  see  a  relatively  high 
rate of direct connection between first-and-second and first-
and-third characters. In other words, instead of a connected 
triangle,  alt  accounts  tend  to  be  connected  in  a  hub-and-
spoke  model 
the  main  account  acts  as  a 
"headquarters"  for  the  friendship  connections  to  the  other 
characters).  In  network  terms,  we  see  a  higher  rate  of 
brokerage than triadic closure [34,39].

Table 8. Negative binomial regression, predicting number of 

characters created, in two types of social network graphs 

To further test the discrepancy between operationalizations 
of  players,  we  ran  two  regressions  predicting  number  of 
characters created, first using a social network made up of 
characters and then a social network made up of users (with 
aggregated statistics). The results demonstrate a difference 
between networks constructed from account- vs. character-
level  perspectives.  Subgraphs  for  active  accounts  and 
characters were created from this original network graph for 
these analyses. 
Given  the  size  of  the  social  network,  analyzing  the  entire 
structure  is  a  challenge.  However,  the  social  context  of 
EVE Online – namely, that players coordinate frequently in 
teams  without  interacting  with  many  other  players  in  the 
entire universe – suggests that we focus our efforts not on 
the entire graph but on subsections of it. Because a player 
may  be  on  the  periphery  of  the  entire  in-game  graph  but 
quite central or influential within their own local team, we 
draw subgraphs of networks from a range of in-game teams.  
When  calculating  network  centrality  measurements  and 
other statistics, we generally favor either local metrics such 
as  degree  (total  number  of  connections  per  account)  and 
clustering (how many of an account’s friends are connected 
to each other) or establish broader centrality scores within a 
player’s team and allies. Therefore, we chose to select 222 
subgraphs,  representing  the  largest  in-game  player  team 

networks (each with over a hundred members), to establish 
centrality  scores  on  a  team  level  as  opposed  to  the  entire 
graph.  This  approach  ensures  that  each  centrality  score 
reported  represents  how  influential  or  well-connected  an 
account  is  within  its  immediate  and  more-relevant  social 
setting. 
The model on the left side of the table takes every user as a 
node within a series of subgraphs drawn from the top teams 
within EVE, while the model on the right uses characters as 
the basic unit of representation. Most of the findings align 
across network models in magnitude and direction, with the 
exception of eigenvector centrality. In the model based off 
of  the  user  graph,  eigenvector  centrality  is  positively 
associated (exp(β) = 1.1251) with creating more characters 
within  EVE.  Importantly,  the  effect  is  reversed  for  the 
character graph (exp(β) = 0.9354). Thus, we do see support 
for  H5:  that  account-level  and  character-level  network 
centrality coefficients will differ. This finding complicates 
H4  – that  higher  eigenvector  centrality  will  be  related  to 
more characters – because depending on the technical user 
representation theory and approach applied to the statistical 
model, conflicting results emerge.  
(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:1)
This  paper  uses  the  case  study  of  a  large  MMORPG  to 
illustrate  the  creation  and  use  of  multiple  technical  user 
representations  (accounts  and  their  respective  characters). 
We examine a population of users from EVE Online across 
8  years  of  player  data  since  the  game’s  launch,  showing 
empirical  evidence  for  multiple  character  use  at  scale  and 
demonstrating  –  from  a  methodological perspective – how 
multiple  characters  can  complicate 
tests, 
especially when it comes to social networks.  
(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:32)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:26)(cid:35)(cid:28)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:33)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:38)(cid:29)(cid:26)(cid:40)(cid:32)(cid:36)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:39)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:40)(cid:31)(cid:36)(cid:28)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:21)(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:36)(cid:38)(cid:44)(cid:1)
The first half of this paper showed that accounts still tend to 
create only one character. However, it is not uncommon to 
fill out the three possible character slots, and there remains 
a  long  tail  of  multiple  character  use.  Earlier  in  this  paper, 
we pointed to scholars that had mentioned or examined alts 
qualitatively,  showing  that  it  was  certainly  a  practice 
amongst  many  game  players,  but  they  could  not  describe 
exactly how common the practice was at scale. This finding 
confirms  most  of  the  qualitative  insights  from  interviews 
and coincides with prior sampling distributions, but it is the 
first time a holistic set of statistics for the use of multiple 
technical representations has been calculated. 
The  question  then  is  how  much  and  in  what  ways  these 
characters are played. Players that dedicated themselves to 
more than one character, as we show above, are definitely 
in  the  minority,  but  they  provide  us  insight  into  the 
differences across characters when multiple are used. There 
are  also  distinctive  differentiating  trends  amongst  player 
demographics regarding character creation. We show above 
that  there  is  a  statistically  significant  difference  between 
men and women, players at different ages, and players from 
primarily-English-language countries. In general, it appears 

statistical

that  all  types  of  players  are  willing  to  explore  creating 
multiple  technical  representations.  While  we  do  not  have 
data  related  to  gameplay  styles,  the  next  step  in  future 
research would be to examine demographic differences and 
how  they  relate  to  multiple  character  use  as  far  as 
motivations  and  gameplay  choices,  to  see  how  these 
multiple characters are used in different ways. 
The second half of this paper examined how gameplay and 
social  relationships  differed  across  multiple  character  use. 
Looking  at  all  active  accounts  that  had  created  three 
characters  at  the  time  of  the  data  collection  snapshot,  we 
clustered and generated five general categories of accounts: 
three that primarily use one character to varying degrees, a 
fourth that primarily focused on two characters, and a fifth 
where all three characters are used to a large extent.  
(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:18)(cid:26)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:30)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:29)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:31)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:17)(cid:1)(cid:14)(cid:30)(cid:18)(cid:1)
First, we explore the question of activity, related to minutes 
spent  playing  and  skill  point  accumulated  on  each 
character.  Because 
the  clusters  were  generated  from 
minutes played, we see a distinct separation related to how 
characters are used in comparing all three characters across 
the  five  clusters.  Again,  this  clustering  technique  looks  at 
the relationship between all three characters (so while some 
players may play with one character just as much as another 
cluster,  their  second  and  third  characters  differ  between 
clusters). We also see a similar trend in relative skill points 
accumulated per character across the five account clusters. 
The interesting insight into multiple character use related to 
playtime minutes and skill points is that accounts that tend 
to dedicate gameplay to one main character play more and 
gain more skill points than accounts focused on two or three 
characters.  Of  course,  this  finding  relates  back  to  our 
coverage  of  entry  costs  at  the  beginning  of  the  paper: 
dedicating time to alts means not being able to play on the 
main character.  
For  avatar-related  decisions,  we  do  not  see  any  great 
difference across multiple character use related to character 
gender  and  race.  Overall,  the  general  trend  remains  the 
same whether an account focuses on one main or multiple 
alts:  the  character  gender  will  frequently  be  the  same,  but 
the  character  race  will  frequently  be  different.  Character 
race directly relates to how players progress at a gameplay 
level  in  EVE:  therefore,  choosing  different  races  in  EVE 
likely reflects players' needs to explore more of the game. 
On  the  other  hand,  for  gender,  it  appears  that  this  avatar 
attribute reflects a personal level in the game, since gender 
has  no  impact  on  gameplay.  This  large-scale  empirical 
finding falls in line with the qualitative and smaller survey 
literature  on  avatars,  gender,  and  roleplay  [6,19,40,43], 
where exploring gender is not a common practice.  
(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:29)(cid:18)(cid:26)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:30)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:15)(cid:33)(cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:26)(cid:17)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:31)(cid:34)(cid:27)(cid:29)(cid:23)(cid:30)(cid:1)
Finally, and most importantly, we do see differences related 
to multiple character use in how these characters are used 
socially.  Just  like  minutes  and  skill  points,  friendships 

659

this 

time  played  and  demographics 

increase  as  one-character  accounts  are  played  more,  and 
decrease slightly for two- and three-character accounts. We 
also see much better-connected characters as the number of 
minutes and alt characters increases. However, and this is a 
critical  finding  for  the  interpretation  of  in-game  social 
networks: we see much more brokerage (path distance of 2, 
reflecting a hub-and-spoke model) than triadic closure (path 
distance  of  1  between  all  three  characters).  This  may 
explain previous findings which correlated brokerage with 
in-game  success  [34].  Instead  of  representing  characters 
interacting with disparate parts of the social graph within a 
game  inter-character  brokerage  demonstrates  how  a  single 
user can use multiple characters as supports for one primary 
account. 
The network comparison provides the most critical point in 
considering  an  individual’s  technical  representation.  The 
regression  results  presented  in  Table  8  generally  confirm 
the  findings  from  Table  5  regarding  the  relationship 
between 
to  character 
creation.  However, 
table  demonstrates  different 
operationalizations  of  technical  user  representations  and 
shows how they can influence the results of a given study.  
As  we  stated  earlier,  the  eigenvector  results  reverse  given 
account-  or  character-level  construction  of  the  network. 
This  change  can  be  explained  as  an  interaction  between 
player  behavior  and  the  way  eigenvector  centrality  is 
calculated.  As  demonstrated  in  Figure  10,  active  players 
tend  to  keep  their  alternative  accounts  adjacent  to  each 
other  within  the  in-game  social  network.  This  inflates  the 
number  of  ties  between  their  characters  and  thus  changes 
each  character’s  eigenvector  centrality,  creating  a 
correlation between an account having more characters and 
an  account’s  network  position.  In  other  words:  the  more-
active  alt  characters  that  the  player  has  close  by  in  the 
network, the higher their centrality.  
To  note,  this  result  is  complicated  by  the  technical 
limitations  put  in  place  by  the  game  developers.  Each 
account is limited to only three active character slots, so a 
character  with  three  alts  will  have  the  highest  rate  of 
centrality  inflation  but  also  the  highest  cost  to  creating  a 
new  character  (as  they  will  have  to  delete  on  of  their 
existing avatars to make room for a new one). This situation 
results  in  a  negative  association  between  eigenvector 
centrality  and  total  characters  because  as  centrality  is 
inflated, the cost of creating a new character multiplies. 
Collapsing  the  network  so  that  nodes  represent  users  does 
away with this inflation and demonstrates that more-central 
players are more likely to have more characters. While the 
exact  mechanism  behind  this  correlation  requires  further 
study, we speculate that this may be a case where the total 
number  of  characters  created  serves  as  a  proxy  for 
experience or expertise within the game, leading to greater 
influence and status within the in-game social network.

Our 

theories 

about 

Beyond  time  dedicated  to  characters,  the  use  of  multiple 
characters has important implications for gameplay choices 
and  especially  the  interpretation  of  server  log  data  at  an 
account  level.  Below,  we  dive  deeper  into  the  differences 
across the gameplay clusters. 
The finding about path distance has critical implications for 
the  analysis  of  in-game  social  networks.  Social  network 
analysis  can  suffer  from  sampling  and  ideally  should  be 
conducted with the entire network; however, even with an 
entire  network,  multiple  character  use 
introduces  a 
confound  of  ego  network  structure  that  may  skew  social 
network  results  significantly  by  inflating  the  rate  of 
brokerage seen in structural surveys of in-game networks. 
The phenomenon of multiple character use is an important 
cultural  and  methodological  hurdle 
to  understanding 
technical  user  representation  and  behavioral  interpretation 
from server log data. Based on the results, especially when 
employing  social  network  analysis,  we  recommend  that 
future research control for multiple characters per account. 
Beyond  methodology,  however,  sociotechnical  theories 
should also consider these implications to a higher degree.  
When we conceptualize participants within a sociotechnical 
system,  we  need  to  challenge  the  ease  of  mapping  one 
individual with one user account with the evolving practices 
of  using  multiple  profiles,  characters,  and  other 
representations. 
individual 
representation currently focus on a wide array of emergent 
practices  (again,  see 
the 
beginning),  but  on  a  quantitative  level,  we  do  little  to 
support 
around 
multiplicative  identity.  This  paper  contributes  to  our 
theoretical 
technical 
representations  by  establishing  a  baseline  for  how  often 
these behaviors occur and how we can further think about 
their 
in 
sociotechnical systems. 
(cid:14)(cid:32)(cid:34)(cid:32)(cid:40)(cid:26)(cid:40)(cid:32)(cid:36)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:1)
While this paper provides an empirical and methodological 
contribution 
technical  user 
representations, it does have some limitations. First, while 
we were granted access to a large portion of the server log 
data from the population of EVE players, we did not have 
granular, 
in-game  actions. 
Therefore, while we use the snapshot of gameplay statistics 
taken at the end of the collection period, more varied data 
would illuminate the variations in gameplay styles that we 
could not discuss in this paper. Also, additional population 
data across a variety of games – and especially other social 
media  platforms, 
for  generalizability  – would  allow 
comparisons as to how the design of account and character 
creation,  as  well  as  in-game  mechanics,  influence  the  rate 
of adoption and methods of use of multiple avatars. 
Second,  while  players  can  create  multiple  characters,  they 
can also create multiple user accounts. The motivations in

an MMOG setting for creating multiple accounts are varied: 
for example, limitations on character creation, the structure 
of monetary transactions to pay for additional characters, or 
other game mechanics that limit gameplay in certain ways 
may  lead  players  to  adopt  multiple,  separate  accounts.  In 
the case of EVE, players cannot train multiple characters at 
the same time, so creating multiple accounts is one method 
to achieving better characters. Further, there is an additional 
financial  incentive,  where  players  can  pay  money  to  train 
multiple  characters. 5  Finally,  the  cultural  atmosphere  of 
intrigue  and  spying  within  the  EVE  universe  may  prompt 
some players to adopt multiple accounts to hide themselves 
when  conducting  covert  operations  against  other  players. 
Players sometimes boast they own multiple accounts.6 Our 
analysis of the dataset cannot tease apart multiple accounts 
owned by distinct individuals.  
Finally, because we only look at server log data, we do not 
have insights into the motivations and strategies that players 
exhibit  and  employ  when  creating  and  using  multiple 
character avatars. Future research could pair server log data 
with survey data to examine at a high level and large scale 
what  kinds  of  personalities  and  decisions  lead  to  the 
adoption  of  different  technical  identities.  Another  possible 
limitation is the possibility that one account may represent 
multiple  people  sharing  characters.  Further  survey  and 
interview research is needed to establish its prevalence. 
(cid:8)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:8)(cid:14)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:16)(cid:1)
People use multiple accounts, profiles, and characters for a 
variety  of  reasons,  from  privacy  to  exploration.  Even  as 
sociotechnical  systems  continue  to  evolve  and  introduce 
new  designs  for  identity,  emergent  behaviors  -  like  the 
creation  of  multiple  technical  user  representations  -  will 
introduce  unique  practices  and  keep  challenging  research 
into human behavior. This paper explores the creation and 
use  of  main  and  alt  characters  in  a  massively  multiplayer 
online  game  to  present  an  empirical  study  of  alternative 
character use at a population level. We show the differences 
across different amount of character use, particularly related 
to  behavioral  data,  and  argue  that  not  accounting  for 
multiple characters can skew the results of certain analysis, 
such as that of social networks.
