Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends’ activities to a user through activity feeds, which may inﬂuence the user’s next actions. However, identifying such social inﬂuence is tricky because these activities are simulteously impacted by inﬂuence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people’s actions to estimate the extent of copy-inﬂuence—mimicking others’ actions that aear in a feed. We assume that non-friends don’t inﬂuence users; thus, comparing how a user’s activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-inﬂuence. Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don’t account for homophily overestimate copy-inﬂuence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-inﬂuence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not aected by the feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of copy-inﬂuence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion and recommendation models.
