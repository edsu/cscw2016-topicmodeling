To help activists call new volunteers to action, we present Botivist: a platform that uses Twitter bots to ﬁnd potential volunteers and request contributions. By leveraging diffent Twitter accounts, Botivist employs different strategies to encourage participation. We explore how people respond to bots calling them to action using a test case about corruion in Latin America. Our results show that the majority of volunteers (> 80%) who responded to Botivist’s calls to aion contributed relevant proposals to address the assigned sial problem. Different strategies produced differences in the quantity and relevance of contributions. Some strategies that work well ofﬂine and face-to-face appeared to hinder pele’s participation when used by an online bot. We analyze user behavior in response to being approached by bots with an activist purpose. We also provide strong evidence for the value of this type of civic media, and derive design implicions.
