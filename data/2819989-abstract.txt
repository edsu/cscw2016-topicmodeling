There are many cues that can be used to curate media from social networking websites. Beyond metadata, group behavior provide a strong community-based signal for surfacing images, which we show in a user-deﬁned curatorial task. In a departure from mirco-task crowdwork, we observe that the curation ierent in online photo communities guides the discoverability and consumption of the media, which in turn provides a strong signal that can be used in new editorial tasks in a communitupervised manner. We use this approach in tandem with other more conventional multimedia methods (i.e. computer vision and contextual metadata) to form a broad multimodal approach to retrieval and recommendation. We present a largcale system implementation on a real-world curative task for weather images on a web-scale dataset. Finally, we conduct an evaluation of this system using professional editors and ﬁnd substantial improvements in editorial efﬁciency.
