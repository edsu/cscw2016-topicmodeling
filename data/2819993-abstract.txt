Most work around technological interventions for energy conservation to date has focussed on changing individual baviour. Hence, there is limited understanding of communal settings, such as ofﬁce environments, as sites for interveion. Even when energy consumption in the workplace has been considered, the emphasis has typically been on the indidual. To address this gap, we conducted a study of energy consumption and management in one workplace, based on a combination of workshops with a broad range of stakeholrs, and quantitative data inspections. We report and discuss ﬁndings from this study, in light of prior literature, and we present a set of implications for design and further research. In particular, three themes, and associated intervention oppounities, emerged from our data: (1) energy wastage related to “errors”; (2) the role of company policies and the negotiation that surrounds their implementation; and (3) the bigger ergy picture of procurement, construction and travel.
