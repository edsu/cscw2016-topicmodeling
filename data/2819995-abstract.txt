Mobile crowd-tasking markets are growing at an unprecented rate with increasing number of smartphone users. Such platforms differ from their online counterparts in that they demand physical mobility and can beneﬁt from smarhone processors and sensors for veriﬁcation purposes. Dpite the importance of such mobile crowd-tasking markets, little is known about the labor supply dynamics and mobility patterns of the users. In this paper we design, develop and experiment with a reaorld mobile crowd-tasking platform, called TA$Ker. Our contributions are two-fold: (a) We develop TA$Ker, a syem that allows us to empirically study the worker respons to push vs. pull strategies for task recommendation and selection. (b) We evaluate our system via experimentation with 80 real users on our campus, over a 4 week period with a corpus of over 1000 tasks. We then provide an in-depth analysis of labor supply, worker behavior & task selection preferences (including the phenomenon of super agents who complete large portions of the tasks) and the efﬁcacy of pusased approaches that recommend tasks based on predicted movement patterns of individual workers.
