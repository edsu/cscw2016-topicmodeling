While online social networks (OSNs) play a critical role in developing social capital [?], many communities are unable to utilize the beneﬁts of OSNs due to lack of Internet acceibility. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of the Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) associated with FM radio stations as a means to deliver social network content to OSN users who do not have access to Internet services. Using Instagram as a case study, we analyze data from 254 public Instagram users associated with the Tribal Digital Viage (TDV) network in Southern California. Our analysis of over 1.2 million unique Instagram posts reveals that Instram users in the TDV network interact with locally gerated content 46.6× more often than content generated by users from outside the network. We use our observations of OSN usage to compare ﬁve OSN content scheduling aroaches. Our evaluation reveals that up to 81% of users reived at least half of their content requests and 35.5% of the 1.1 million requested Instagram photos were transmitted to users.
