Despite recent efforts in opening up government data, deloping tools for taxpayers to make sense of extensive and multi-faceted budget data remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present BudgetMap, an issue-driven classiﬁ- cation and navigation interface for the budgets of goverent programs. Our novel issue-driven approach can colement the traditional budget classiﬁcation system used by government organizations by reﬂecting time-evolving puic interests. BudgetMap elicits the public to tag goverent programs with social issues by providing two modes of tagging. User-initiated tagging allows people to voluarily search for programs of interest and classify each prram with related social issues, while system-initiated taing guides people through possible matches of issues and programs via microtasks. BudgetMap then facilitates visual exploration of the tagged budget data. Our evaluation shows that participants’ awareness and understanding of budgetary issues increased after using BudgetMap, while they collabatively identiﬁed issue-budget links with quality comparable to expert-generated links.
