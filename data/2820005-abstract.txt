Task execution timeliness, the completion of a task within a given time frame, is a known open issue in crowourcing. While running tasks on crowdsourcing platforms a requester experiences long tails in execution caused by abaoned assignments (those left by workers unﬁnished), which become available for other workers only after some expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes in CrowdFlower). These abandoned aignments result in signiﬁcant delays and a poor predictabity of the overall task execution time. In this paper, we prose an approach and an implementation called ReLauncher to identify such abandoned assignments and relaunch them for other workers. We evaluate our implementation with an experiment on CrowdFlower that provides substantive evence for a signiﬁcant execution speed improvement with an average extra cost of about 10%.
