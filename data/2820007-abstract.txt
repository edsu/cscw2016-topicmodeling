The development of strong social and emotional skills is ceral to personal wellbeing. Increasingly, these skills are bng taught in schools through well researched curricula. Such social-emotional learning (SEL) curricula are most effective if reinforced by parents, thus transferring the skills into everay contexts. Traditional SEL programs have however had limited success in engaging parents, and we argue that tecology might be able to help bridge this school-home divide. Through interviews with SEL experts we identiﬁed central design considerations for technology and SEL content: the reliance on experiential learning and the need to scaffold the parents in scaffolding the interaction for their children. This informed the design of a technology probe comprising a maet card and online SEL activities, deployed in a school and via Mturk. The results provide a nuanced understanding of how technology-based interventions could bridge the schooome gap in real-world settings and support at-home reiorcement of children’s social-emotional skills.
