Personalized support for students is a gold standard in educion, but it scales poorly with the number of students. Prior work on learnersourcing presented an approach for learners to engage in human computation tasks while trying to learn a new skill. Our key insight is that students, through their own experience struggling with a particular problem, can become experts on the particular optimizations they implent or bugs they resolve. These students can then generate hints for fellow students based on their new expertise. We present workﬂows that harvest and organize students’ colleive knowledge and advice for helping fellow novices through design problems in engineering. Systems embodying each workﬂow were evaluated in the context of a college-level computer architecture class with an enrollment of more than two hundred students each semester. We show that, given our design choices, students can create helpful hints for their peers that augment or even replace teachers’ personalized aistance, when that assistance is not available.
