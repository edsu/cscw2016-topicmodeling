We present the ﬁndings from a study of how people interleave mobile phone use with conversation in pubs. Our ﬁndings, informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, uack the interactional methods through which groups of people in pubs occasioned, sustained, and disengaged from mobile dice use during conversation with friends. Fundamentally, the work that is done consists of various methods of accounting for mobile device use, and displaying involvement in social interaction while the device is used. We highlight multiple examples of the nuanced ways in which interleaving is proematic in interaction, and relate our ﬁndings to the CSCW and HCI literature on collocated interaction. We conclude by considering avenues for future research, and discuss how we may support or disrupt interleaving practices through design to overcome the highlighted interactional troubles.
