ABSTRACT
Compounding of natural language units is a very common
phenomena. In this paper, we show, for the ﬁrst time, that
Twitter hashtags which, could be considered as correlates of
such linguistic units, undergo compounding. We identify rea-
sons for this compounding and propose a prediction model
that can identify with 77.07% accuracy if a pair of hashtags
compounding in the near future (i.e., 2 months after com-
pounding) shall become popular. At longer times T = 6, 10
months the accuracies are 77.52% and 79.13% respectively.
This technique has strong implications to trending hashtag
recommendation since newly formed hashtag compounds can
be recommended early, even before the compounding has
taken place. Further, humans can predict compounds with an
overall accuracy of only 48.7% (treated as baseline). Notably,
while humans can discriminate the relatively easier cases,
the automatic framework is successful in classifying the rela-
tively harder cases.

INTRODUCTION
Hashtag is the new “paralanguage” of Twitter. What started
as a way for people to connect with others and to orga-
nize similar tweets together, propagate ideas, promote spe-
ciﬁc people or topics has now grown into a language of
its own. As hashtags are created by people on their own,
any new event or topic can be referred to by a variety of
hashtags. This linguistic innovation in the form of hash-
tags is a very special feature of Twitter which has become
immensely popular and are also widely adopted in various
other social media like Facebook, Google+ etc. and have
been studied extensively by researchers to analyze the com-
petition dynamics, the adoption rate and popularity scores.
However, there are very few attempts to study the linguistic

aspects of hashtag evolution over large time scales. One of
the interesting and prevalent linguistic phenomena in today’s
world of brief expressions, chats etc. is hashtag compound-
ing where new hashtags are formed through combination of
two or more hashtags together with the form of the individual
hashtags remaining intact. For example, #PeoplesChoice and
#Awards together form #PeoplesChoiceAwards. #KellyRipa
and #CelebrationMonth make #KellyRipaCelebrationMonth;
#WikipediaBlackout is formed from #Wikipedia and #Black-
out; #OregonBelieveMovieMeetup is formed from #Oregon,
#BelieveMovie and #Meetup; #Educational, #Ipad, #Apps to-
gether make #EducationalIpadApps etc.
In this paper, we
identify for the ﬁrst time that while some of these compounds
gain a high frequency of usage over time (even higher than
the individual constituents) many of them are soon lost into
oblivion. We focus and investigate in detail the reasons be-
hind the above observations.

Motivations
In etymology, we come across a very similar phenomenon
where words are formed from various other words sampled
from the same or a different language. Lexical compound-
ing has been prevalent all through over the history of evo-
lution of any language [4, 25, 23]. For example, in En-
glish, ‘wheelchair’ has been formed from ‘wheel’ and ‘chair’,
bookworm is the combination of ‘book’ and ‘worm’ with
the meaning of the words getting completely modiﬁed due
to compounding. Similarly, ‘in so far’ has become ‘insofar’
with no meaning getting altered. However, such compound-
ing phenomena in social media are far more prevalent than in
standard texts and language.
Innovation and adoption are both important processes in lan-
guage change [15, 45]. While innovation refers to the cre-
ation of new linguistic units, adoption refers to its prolifer-
ation among wider groups of speakers. An innovative form
must be adopted by a signiﬁcant number of speakers in or-
der for observable change to take place [45]. Hashtag is a
linguistic innovation in social media. Predicting the propaga-
tion and spread of hashtags in online communities is an im-
portant aspect from both commercial and psychological per-
spectives. Not all hashtags become popular, some of them
become popular while most of them fall into oblivion. There
are numerous factors that drive hashtag popularity and this
popularity aspect have been studied extensively by various
researchers [31, 32, 38, 40, 41, 59, 63, 64, 67]. A signiﬁcant
proportion of the hashtags used in social media are compound
hashtags. In this paper, we attempt to early predict whether a
hashtag compound shall gain a higher usage frequency (pop-
ularity) than the individual constituent hashtags forming the

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

compound. Note that our objective does not include identi-
fying if two or more hashtags are going to compound in fu-
ture; instead, we are interested to automatically identify cases
where the popularity of an already formed compound is far
more than the individual components.

Compounds in Practice
Like general hashtags, predicting popular hashtag compound-
ing is also an important and interesting task. There are mar-
keting strategic needs, needs for fulﬁlling communicative in-
tents (affective expression, political persuasion, humor etc.)
as well as spontaneous needs for use of hashtag compounds.
For example, the e-commerce company Amazon used #Ama-
zonPrimeDay to promote the discounted sale of its product.
The hashtag is a compound of #Amazon and #PrimeDay
whereas the individual hashtag #PrimeDay was also popular.
So, there is a trade-off whether to use hashtag compounds or
the uncompounded constituents. Similarly, assume another
scenario where an event is taking place, say the premiere of a
movie ‘The Imitation Game’. Here one can use both the hash-
tags #TheImitationGame and #Premiere or can use a hashtag
compound #TheImitationGamePremiere. In this context, one
needs to identify which version one should use so that the
hashtag being used gains a higher frequency of usage in the
near future. #CSCW2016 is being used to tag the activities
taking place related to the 2016 CSCW conference. This is
also a compound hashtag made of #CSCW and #2016 where
#CSCW refers to all CSCW conferences and #2016 refers
to all the events/activities going to take place in 2016. The
hashtag #CSCW2016 is used for a more focused purpose and
refering to only the 2016 edition of the conference whereas
#CSCW could also have served the purpose. Hashtag com-
pounds also serve the communicative intents like political
campaign hashtags (#PresidentTrump = #President + #Trump
: hashtag that shows support for Donald Trump for the 2016
US Presidential election). Hashtag compounding also happen
spontaneously. These hashtags are generally conversational
or personal themed hashtags like #TheBestFeelingInARe-
lationship (#TheBestFeeling + #InARelationship), #Throw-
backThursday (#Throwback + #Thursday), #ComeOnNow-
DontLie (#ComeOnNow + #DontLie).
Our prediction framework is different from existing popular-
ity prediction/trend identiﬁcation algorithms/frameworks in
the following ways. The popularity prediction frameworks
deal with the problem of predicting whether a hashtag will be-
come popular or not among a competing hashtag pool consist-
ing of all hashtags across various topics from the data stream
and ﬁltered by the time window in which the prediction is be-
ing made. However, in our framework, we want to predict
whether the hashtag compound or the individual constituent
hashtags become popular. Therefore, our competition space
is smaller and topically more well-deﬁned. This is simply to
say whether to adopt the compounded hashtags or not.

Research objectives and contributions
In this paper, we study the hashtag compounding phenomena
as a linguistic innovation and investigate in detail the socio-
linguistic reasons for its adoption. Towards this objective, we
make the following contributions in the paper:

51

• We study the hashtag compounding phenomena for the ﬁrst
time and put forward various socio-linguistic reasons for
the adoption (popularity) of the compound hashtags

• We conduct a thorough experiment with human subjects
to identify how well humans can predict popular hashtag
compounds; the accuracy obtained is 48.7% and consti-
tutes the baseline.

• We ﬁnally use the socio-linguistic aspects as features in a
model that is able to predict popular future hashtag com-
pounds (T = 2 months) with an overall accuracy of 77.07%
which is ∼58% improvement over the baseline. Note that
our results have the potential to strongly impact the trend-
ing hashtag recommendation application of Twitter since
it is able to predict hashtags (i.e., compounds) that will be
popular in future even before the hashtags are born (i.e.,
before the compounding has taken place).

• We also perform long term predictions at T = 6 and 10
months after compounding and achieve 77.5% and 79.13%
accuracy respectively.

• Finally, we perform a thorough correspondence analysis of
the prediction outcomes from human evaluations and the
automatic framework. We observe striking differences be-
tween the outcomes; while human evaluators are usually
able to discriminate the relatively easier cases, the auto-
matic framework is very successful in distinguishing some
of the harder cases. We argue that this is a methodological
novelty of this paper and can be adopted in future experi-
mental studies of similar type.

Organization of the paper
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
2 is a concise review of the state-of-the-art. In section 3, we
describe the dataset brieﬂy. In section 4, we discuss about the
adoption/popularity of hashtag compounds. Section 5 inves-
tigates the different linguistic aspects responsible for hashtag
compounding. In section 6, we outline the baseline experi-
ments based on the human judgments. In section 7, we intro-
duce the prediction model and describe the features. In sec-
tion 8, we evaluate the model and discuss the discriminative
power of the features. In section 9, we perform a detailed cor-
respondence analysis of the hashtags judged by human eval-
uators and by the automatic prediction framework. In section
10, we discuss the implications of the ﬁndings from our study.
Finally, in section 11, we conclude and point to future direc-
tion of research.

RELATED WORK
Language use in social media
There have been considerable works that focus on the con-
tent and its linguistic aspects in social media. Honeycutt and
Herring [28] analyzed conversational exchanges in Twitter fo-
cusing on mentions. Ritter et al. [51] developed an unsuper-
vised learning approach to identify conversational structure
from open-topic conversations. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et
al. [17] studied how people adopt linguistic styles while in
conversation on Twitter. Eisenstein et al. [20] studied the role

of geography and demographics on the language in Twitter.
Hong et al. [29] investigated the cultural differences in Twit-
ter’s language. Hu et al. [30] studied the characterization of
linguistic and psycholinguistic aspects in Twitter. Wang et
al. [62] studied how people curse each other in Twitter. Al-
muhimedi et al. [1] performed a large scale quantitative anal-
ysis on deleted tweets.
There have been several studies on how language is used in
social communities. Kramer et al. [33] characterized different
types of discourse in online support groups (speciﬁcally, emo-
tion writing, talkative, bipolar chat) for successful communi-
ties. Arguello et al. [3] assessed whether members were likely
to post again using linguistic features of their posts. Nguyen
et al. [46] proposed a novel approach to identify latent hyper-
groups in social communities based on users’ language use.
Cassell and Tverky [11] described how linguistic interaction
patterns change over time. Matthews et al. [43] character-
ized how online communities combine multiple social tools.
Tausczik and Pennebaker [57] study the motivation of peo-
ple participation in Q&A sites (MathOverﬂow) and found
that building reputation is an important incentive. Matthews
et al. [42] studied the relationship between member satisfac-
tion and language use within content posted in workplace on-
line communities. Tang et al. [56] analyzed the difference in
language usage of international Facebook users recently mi-
grated to the United States to selectively self-disclose to their
old (native) and new (English-speaking) social circles.

Lexical Compounding
Lexical compounding constitutes an active area of research;
there have been few studies on lexical compounding in En-
glish [4, 25] and other languages like Italian, French, German,
Spanish, Chinese etc. [2, 23, 34, 48, 61]. Pustejovsky [49]
provided one of the earliest explanation of the compounding
phenomena within a compound based on the qualia modiﬁ-
cation relations in the semantic composition within a com-
pound. A recent study by Lee et al. [34] discusses the for-
mation of noun-noun compounds found in Chinese as well
as few other languages like German, Spanish, Japanese and
Italian. Word compounding is often termed as a form of
lexical change which may be caused due to social pressure,
ease of pronunciation. Hacken [58] showed how transla-
tions can be used as heuristics to determine the concept of
compounding. Noun-noun compounding is the most popular
form and most studies are biased on restricting themselves
to this form only. However, Bagasheva in [5] have studied
the characteristics of compound verbs in English and Bul-
garian language and claimed that verbs also compound to a
signiﬁcant extent. Bagasheva also showed that though the
basic types of compound verbs are of the form verb-verb
(blowdry, drinkdrive) and noun-verb (babysit, brainwash,
proofread), other forms like noun-noun (handcuff, stonewall),
adjective-noun (fastrack, badmouth), adjective-verb (white-
wash, dryclean), preposition-noun/preposition-verb (overrun,
underestimate) are also legitimate in English. We shall ob-
serve that similar kinds of POS (Parts of Speech) tag combi-
nations are also present in case of hashtag compounds.
In
principle, we have attempted to merge the socio-linguistic
features with information technological research. All of the

52

SESSION: MODELING SOCIAL MEDIA

above studies in linguistics considered anecdotal evidences
by showcasing various examples and mostly attempted to
study the formation of compounds. The main challenge
of this type of research was the non-availability of tempo-
ral data of language change. We try to bridge the existing
gap by considering large-scale social media data and study
the compounding phenomena assuming hashtags as linguis-
tic units. The previous studies on lexical compounds as dis-
cussed above have been mostly about understanding the for-
mation of compounds whereas our analysis of the hashtag
compounds is focused on the adoption of the compounds.
There are differences in the mechanisms of compound for-
mation in ordinary language and in social media. While lex-
ical compounding is mostly spontaneous in nature, there are
many purposes to which hashtag compounds are being put
in social media. One aspect of it is market strategic hash-
tags like #AmazonPrimeDay, #CSCW2016 etc. Another rea-
son of it is to fulﬁll communicative intents such as affec-
tive expression, political persuasion, or humor; for example
hashtags like #YesAllWomen, #FeelTheBern, #BlackLives-
Matter, #PresidentTrump etc. There is also spontaneous pres-
sures of compounding like #TheBestFeelingInARelationship,
#YouKnowItsRealWhen, #RelationshipTips etc.
Our work has been inspired by several studies [16, 68, 9, 21]
that focused on hashtags as linguistic units and attempted to
identify the systematic similarities/differences with standard
natural languages entities. Cunha et al. [16] studied hash-
tags as linguistic innovation and characterized the formation
and usage of Twitter hashtags. Zappavigna [68] explored how
hashtags enact three simultaneous communicative functions:
marking experiential topics, enacting interpersonal relation-
ships, and organizing text. Calefﬁ [9] analyzed hashtagging
as a productive process of word formation in English and Ital-
ian.

Lexical Blending
Another closely related innovation phenomena is lexical
blending where a word is formed from two or more words
fused into one another. For example, brunch (breakfast +
lunch), fantabulous (fantastic + fabulous), entertoyment (en-
tertainment + toy) etc. This linguistic form of word reduction
has been studied widely [8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 24, 36, 44, 50].
Gaskell and Marslen–Wilson [24] have proposed a distributed
model of speech perception for identiﬁcation of blends, ambi-
guity etc. in spoken language. Cook and Stevenson [14] have
proposed a statistical model for identifying the lexical blend’s
source words from the observed linguistic properties of the
blend. In a subsequent study, Cook [13] has proposed a regu-
lar expression based method for identifying lexical blends in
social media.

Hashtag popularity
Hashtags are a way for social media users to tag their posts
with keywords, which in turn helps in meaningfully organiz-
ing the posts to make the contents on social networks easily
searchable. Hashtags have various utilities. These are used
in social campaigns, political campaigns, marketing and so
on. They also provide great way to get people talking, and
let them jump into discussions. For example, #Polichat is a

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

popular stream of conversation used by political and digital
professionals. Therefore, it is important to know the popu-
lar and trending hashtags so that it is possible to ﬁlter out
meaningful contents from the streams of data. There have
been many studies on hashtag adoption (popularity) [31, 32,
38, 40, 41, 59, 63, 64, 67]. Tsur and Rappoport in [59] per-
formed content based prediction of hashtag popularity. Ma et
al. in [41] proposed a framework for predicting popularity of
newly emergent hashtags. They showed that the contextual
features based on the underlying social network of the users
of the hashtag are more important than the content based fea-
tures in predicting the popularity of a hashtag on a daily ba-
sis. Kamath and Caverlee [31] have modeled the geo-spatial
propagation of online information spread to identify which
hashtags will become popular in speciﬁc locations. Another
notion of hashtag popularity is the “burstiness” of hashtag, the
phenomena which involes sudden rise in hashtag usage and
quick fall thereafter. Kong et al. [5, 32] studied the burstiness
of hashtag on a temporal scale.
While retweets and followers support a hashtag’s growth,
they also paradoxically undermine its persistence. Various
researchers have tried to systematically analyze the features
that contribute to the growth and stabilization of the hashtags.
Yang and Scott [66] examined the roles of “relevance” and
“exposure” for hashtag adoption [66]. Yang et al. [67] stud-
ied the duality of hashtags as topical identiﬁers and a symbol
of community membership. Lin et al. [38] studied the growth,
survival, and context of novel hashtags during the 2012 U.S.
presidential debate. They proposed a framework to capture
dynamics of hashtags based on their topicality, interactivity,
diversity, and prominence.

Adoption and propagation of topical information in Twit-
ter
There have been several studies on the roles the users play
in adoption and propagation of topical information in Twitter.
Lerman and Ghosh [35] studied the user activities in Digg and
Twitter. Lin et al. [37] studied the evolution of a topic and re-
vealed the diffusion path of the topic in the community. They
proposed a probabilistic model based on textual documents,
social inﬂuences of the users and topic evolution. Romero et
al. [53] observed that different topical category (sports, mu-
sic, Idioms) of hashtags have different propagation pattern.
Gomez et al. [26] studied the information diffusion among
blogs and online news sources. Wu et al. [65] analyzed the
“elite” users and their roles in information spread. Starbird et
al. [55] and Vieweg et al. [60] addressed the characterization
of events (natural hazards) by the Twitter users who posted
tweets among them. Shamma et al. [54] proposed metrics
for identiﬁcation of nature of topics/ events (peaky or persis-
tent) in Twitter data stream. De Choudhury et al. [18] char-
acterized Twitter users into three primary categories: organi-
zations, journalists/media bloggers, and ordinary individuals.
Bhattacharya et al. [6] characterized topical groups based on
their network structures and tweeting behaviors. They distin-
guish between two types of users within a topical group; ex-
perts who are likely to be authoritative sources of information

the above approaches

on speciﬁc topics, and seekers who are interested in gathering
information on these topics.
Most of
in lexical compound-
ing/blending propose theories/hypotheses with anecdotal ev-
idences from various languages. However, we perform an
in-depth large scale analysis of hashtag compounding phe-
nomena and the adoption characteristics of the hashtag com-
pounds in social media from publicly available data. We pro-
pose a prediction framework for early prediction of the popu-
lar hashtag compounds that is manifolds better than the base-
line system based on human judgments.

DATASET DESCRIPTION
Twitter provides 1% random sample of all the tweets via its
sample API in real time. This API has been used to crawl
tweets from 1st July, 2011 to 31st December, 2013. For anal-
ysis, we consider the users who have mentioned English as
their language in their proﬁle. We also performed a sec-
ond level ﬁltering of the tweets by a language detection soft-
ware [39] to remove any non-English tweets from the dataset.
The data are then tokenized using the same tokenizer used by
the CMU POS tagger [47]. In total, the dataset consists of
∼ 1 billion tweets.

ADOPTION OF HASHTAG COMPOUNDS
In this section, we discuss the phenomena of compounding
and the adoption of hashtag compounds in social media. For
detection of the hashtag compound, we consider 6 months
data from 1st January, 2012 to 30th June, 2012. For any
hashtag of length ≥ 6 in this data, of the form #AB, we
search for #A and #B in the data from 1st July, 2011 till
the time point when the ﬁrst appearance of #AB is found.
Note that, both #A and #B themselves could be single words
or compound words. For example, #HighSchoolMemories
(#HighSchool + #Memories), #NeverShouldYouEver (#Nev-
erShould + #YouEver) etc. We restrict our study to hashtag
compounds that are formed by only two constituent hashtags
(i.e., ignore further divisions of the constituent hashtags). To
avoid ambiguity, we do not consider those compounds that
can be formed due to the compounding of multiple pairs of
constituent hashtags. For example, #IStillHaventStarted (#IS-
till + #HaventStarted or # IStillHavent + #Started).
Note that not all hashtag compounds become popular after the
compounding. Out of ∼ 2 million candidate compounds, only
2% are found to attain a frequency of usage more than both
the constituent hashtags. In table 1, we show some examples
of the compounds which are more frequently used than the
constituent hashtags right from the point of the compound
formation. In the same table, we also present examples of
some compounds that do not gain frequency after the com-
pound formation. Without loss of generality, we refer to the
ﬁrst type of hashtag compound as “popular” and the second
type as “unpopular”. We study in detail these two types of
compound hashtags and their properties, thereby, identify-
ing factors differentiating them. Understanding the precise
reasons for certain compounds becoming popular could have
far reaching impact both linguistically as well as in trending
hashtag recommendation service where recommendation of a

Popularity trend of the hashtag compounds
In this subsection, we shall discuss about the monthly popu-
larity trend (frequency of the hashtag in tweets) of the pop-
ular hashtag compounds in the next 10 months after com-
pounding. We categorize the popular hashtags into some ﬁner
classes - a) the frequency of the compound is always higher
than that of its constituent ones b) the frequency of the com-
pound is always higher compared to its constituent ones ex-
cept for one month c) the frequency of the compound is al-
ways higher compared to its constituent ones except for two
months d) the class containing the rest of the popular hash-
tag compounds. For the ﬁrst three categories, the popular-
ity trend suggests “winner-takes-all”. We also observe that
in many cases, though initially the frequency of the hashtag
compounds remains higher than its constituent hashtag, how-
ever as time progresses the frequency falls below the con-
stituent hashtags (see ﬁg 1(d)). On an average, we see that
for time larger than 2 months from the time point of com-
pounding, this phenomenon takes place. This is the reason
we select the ﬁrst (early) prediction time point T = 2 months
(see section 7 for details).

of compounding for the hashtag triplets (#A, #B and #AB) where the avg.
frequency of the compounded hashtags #AB are higher than both of the con-
stituent hashtags #A and #B a) in all months b) in all but one month c) in all
but two months d) in some months.

LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF HASHTAG COMPOUNDING
This section is inspired by the observations made by re-
searchers working on various aspects of lexical compound-
ing. In addition to this, we also identify certain other interest-
ing issues speciﬁc to hashtag compounding some of which
might be as well generalized to mainstream lexical com-
pounding research. In the rest of this section, we shall dis-
cuss various linguistic aspects of hashtag compound forma-
tion. We shall mostly focus on the compounding zone where
the two constituent hashtags merge.

Part-of-speech combination
In lexical compounding, we ﬁnd evidences of various types
of compounds based on the POS [34] of the individual words
that get compounded across various languages. For example,
noun-noun, verb-noun, noun-verb, verb-verb etc are some
common forms. We hypothesize that a similar phenomenon is
instrumental in case of hashtags also. To validate this hypoth-
esis we POS tag the individual hashtags using the CMU POS
tagger [47], which is the state-of-the-art POS tagger available
for Twitter. For a compound of the form #AB which is made
up of #A and #B, we ﬁnd POS of #A and POS of #B to deter-
mine various combinations of POS-based compound forma-
tion. Note that the individual hashtags #A and #B can them-
selves be also compounds like #ab and #cd where a and b are
words compounding to #A and c and d are words compound-
ing to #B. In such scenarios, we consider the compounding
zone and ﬁnd the POS of the last part of #A (i.e, b) and the
POS of the ﬁrst part of #B (i.e., c). In ﬁgure 2, we show the
distribution of various POS-combinations of the hashtag com-
pounds. We observe that there is a clear distinction present
between the distribution of POS combinations for popular and
unpopular compounds. Most prominent POS combinations in
case of popular compounds are proper noun-proper noun, fol-
lowed by common noun-common noun, determiner-common
noun and verb-determiner; however,
the most prominent
POS combinations for the unpopular hashtag compounds
are common noun-common noun, Adjective-common noun,
determiner-common noun, proper noun-proper noun etc.
Among both popular and unpopular compounds, the common
noun-common noun pair seems to be very prevalent.

Named entity combination
Apart from the POS tags, we also perform named entity
recognition of the constituent hashtags forming the com-
pound to understand which types of entities merge. We use a
named entity recognition tool [52] for identifying named en-
tities of the words in the hashtags forming the compounds.

Figure 2: Distribution of top 20 most prominent combinations of part-of-
speech tags of a) popular b) unpopular compound hashtags. The full form
of the acronyms of the POS tags used here are as follows: ˆ - Proper Noun,
N - Common Noun, O - Pronoun, V - Verb, A - Adjective, R - Adverb, D -
Determiner, P - Pre or post position

For a compound hashtag (#AB = #A + #B where #A = #ab
and #B = #cd), we ﬁnd the named entity of last word of #A
and the named entity of ﬁrst word of #B to determine various
combinations of named entity-based compounding. For other
cases where #A, #B are single words we perform the recogni-
tion directly on these words. Figure 3 shows the distribution
of the top 20 most prominent named entity combinations for
popular (ﬁg 3(a)) as well as unpopular hashtag compounds
(ﬁg 3(b)). Though in 85% cases we ﬁnd that the constituent
words are non-entities, from the remaining 15% cases, we
ﬁnd various named entity combinations and the distribution
of these combinations are indeed very different for the pop-
ular and the unpopular classes. In general, the most preva-
lent named entity combinations where both the constituent
hashtags denote entities are (B-person I-person) followed by
(B-product I-product) and (B-movie I-movie). However, the
fraction of each such pair for the popular compounds is very
different for the unpopular ones.

Out-of-vocabulary / In-vocabulary combination
With the advent of new words/slangs in social media, there
is an increasing trend of usage of out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
words [19]. Motivated by above observation, we study if
OOV words have a role in compound formation. We use
GNU Aspell dictionary to determine whether a given word is
an OOV or INV (In-Vocabulary). As stated earlier, for each
compound hashtag of the form #AB formed by #A and #B,
we ﬁnd the nature of the ending word of #A and the begin-
ning word of #B. In table 2, we report the distribution of var-
ious combinations for both the popular and unpopular com-
pounds. The most prevalent combination in both cases are the
merge of two INV words (though varying in the percentages,
∼ 44% in case of popular compounds compared to ∼ 67% in
case of unpopular compounds). There is also a marked dis-
tinction in the rank order in which the combinations are used
apart from usage variability. The rank order in case of popu-
lar compounds is OOV-OOV, INV-OOV, OOV-INV whereas

for the unpopular ones it is OOV-INV, INV-OOV, OOV-OOV.

BASELINE SYSTEM
The main purpose of the human prediction is to ﬁnd out
whether humans can identify the popular compound just from
the structural information of the hashtags. If humans can eas-
ily identify popular compounds then the whole problem of
predicting popular hashtag compounds is not interesting. The
purpose of this work is to design an automated framework
which will assist humans adopting hashtag compounds that
are going to be popular in near future and we shall compare
how good this system performs by considering human judg-
ment as baseline. To understand whether humans can predict
if a compound is going to be popular in future, we conduct
an online survey1 among 72 agreed participants (students, re-
searchers, professors, technical persons) with ages ranging
between 18-34 years. We choose 600 hashtag compounds
randomly from the set of 2000 compounds used for classiﬁca-
tion (see section 8). Each participant is given a set of 25 ques-
tions. In each question, the participants are given the hashtag
compound as well as the constituent hashtags and are asked
whether the compound hashtag would become more popular
in future than both the constituent hashtags. If they are not
sure of the answer, they have the option to indicate that they

A detailed analysis of the survey results is outlined below.
We receive ∼ 15% responses where the participants indicated
that they are unsure. Out of remaining 85% responses, 53.3%
responses are found to be correct answers. We adopt majority
voting technique to evaluate each question. ∼ 10.5% of the
questions remain undecided due to all the possible answers
getting equal number of votes. Out of the remaining ques-
tions, we obtain an accuracy of 54.5% and an overall accu-
racy of 48.7%. We also perform averaging of responses. For
each hashtag compound, we ﬁnd the fraction of responses in
agreement with the real data. Then, we take average for all
the hashtag compounds. This yields an overall accuracy of
45.33%. To ﬁnd out the inter-evaluator agreement, we com-
pute Fleiss’ Kappa [22] which is found to be 0.15. In order to
identify how the individual user judgments are, we compute
response accuracies for each user separately. The median user
response accuracy comes out to be 44% and the standard de-
viation of the user response accuracies is 0.12. The maximum
and minimum user response accuracies are 68% and 12% re-
spectively.

SESSION: MODELING SOCIAL MEDIA

Due to the 140 character-limit on the tweets, character usage
is vital and is hence a constraint on the size of the hashtags
too. People tend to express their feeling using smaller number
of characters but there is a trade-off; smaller sized hashtags
do not always serve their purpose. Therefore, the number of
characters in the hashtag compound is a feature of the model.

Number of words in the compound hashtag
The number of the words in a compound hashtag is also im-
portant because more words may mean more expressibility.
The compound hashtag might be more expressible than the
constituent hashtags.

Presence of n-grams in English texts
We segment the words in the compound hashtag and search
for 2, 3, 4, 5 grams of the constituent words in the corpus
of 1 million contemporary American English words2. We use
presence of any of these n-grams as a feature for the classiﬁer.

Part-of-speech diversity of the words in the compound
We use standard CMU POS tagger [47] as stated earlier
for identifying the POS tags after segmenting the compound
hashtag into its constituent words. We deﬁne the POS diver-
sity (POSDiv) as follows:

POS Div(hi) = −(cid:88)

j∈P

p j × log(p j)

From the above observations (table 3) and the discussions,
we can conclude that human judgment is on an average poor.
This motivates us to develop an automated prediction frame-
work which as we shall see is highly accurate. We consider
the human judgment accuracies as a baseline for our predic-
tion model presented in the next section.

PREDICTION MODEL
In this section, we propose a model for early prediction of
the “would-be trending” hashtag compounds. For the predic-
tion task, we observe the constituent hashtags (#A, #B) for
t = 6 months before they get compounded together to form
#AB and predict whether #AB will be more popular (in terms
of frequency in tweets) than both #A and #B or not after T
months from the time point of the compounding (see ﬁg 4).
In our setting, we consider T = 2, 6 and 10 months.
For the task of prediction, we learn three major types of fea-
tures :
Hashtag content features - the features that are related to the
content of the hashtag only
Tweet content features - the features that are related to the
tweets in which the hashtags appear
User features - these include various properties of the users
who tweet the hashtags, such as their social inﬂuence etc.

Hashtag content features:
For each hashtag we extract various attributes related to its
content. These are mostly the attributes related to characters,
words and the nature of the words that are used in the hashtag.

where hi is the ith hashtag and p j is the probability that a
word is labeled by the jth POS from the set P of all possible
POS tags. We use this diversity metric as a feature for our
classiﬁer.

Part-of-speech combination
As observed earlier in section 5, there is clear distinction in
the distribution of POS tag combination for the popular and
the unpopular compounds in the compounding zone. Moti-
vated by this observation, we consider the POS tag combina-
tions as features to the classiﬁer. We consider 20 such most
prevalent POS tag combination, each of them acting as a bi-
nary feature.

Named entity combination
Similar to the above feature, we also consider the named en-
tity combination as an important feature for the classiﬁer. In
section 5, we observe that the most prominent named entity
combinations are different for the popular and the unpopular
hashtag compounds. Therefore, we consider 20 most promi-
nent named entity combinations, each one of them as a binary
feature for the classiﬁer.

OOV/INV combination
We also observe in section 5 that there are signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the distribution of the various INV/OOV combi-
nation for the words at the point of merge. To utilize this
striking difference, we consider all four combinations (OOV-
OOV, INV-OOV, OOV-INV, INV-INV) as 4 individual binary
features for the classiﬁer.

Figure 4: A schematic of our proposed framework. Here the popular category refers to those cases where frequency of usage of #AB > frequency of usage of
#A AND frequency of usage of #B. The rest of cases are categorized as unpopular.

Tweet content features:
The content of tweets that use a hashtag is also a signiﬁcant
determinant of the popularity of a hashtag compound. In this
subsection, we shall be describing a series of tweet content
features.

Word overlap
We compute the overlap coefﬁcient3 between the set of words
appearing in tweets with #A and #B. This overlap coefﬁcient
act as a feature for our classiﬁer.

n-gram overlap
For the compounding hashtags #A and #B, we consider the
words appearing in tweets with those hashtags separately and
search for 2, 3, 4, 5 grams in the corpus of 1 million con-
temporary American English words4. We then ﬁnd out the
overlap coefﬁcient between the set of valid n-grams for #A
and #B.

Average frequency of the overlapping set of n-grams
In a similar way as above, we ﬁnd out the average frequency
of the n-grams in the contemporary American English cor-
pus for the overlapping set of n-grams found from the set of
tweets for #A and #B.

Collocation frequency of the compounding pair
To understand whether collocation of the compounding hash-
tags in tweets has effect on the compound formation there-
after, we consider the collocation frequency of the compound-
ing hashtags as feature for the classiﬁcation task.

Clarity of the compounding hashtags
Hashtag clarity, a metric that has been deﬁned in [40] quanti-
ﬁes topical cohesiveness of all the tweets in which the hashtag
appears. Clarity of hashtag i (HashClarity(i)) is computed as
the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the unigram
3overlap coefﬁcient between two sets A and B is given by
overlap(A, B) = |A∩B|
min(|A|,|B|)

language model inferred from the document Di containing all
the tweets for the ith hashtag and the background language
model from the entire tweet collection T. If a hashtag refers
to a speciﬁc topic, then the high probabilities of a few topic-
relevant words distinguish its tweets from the background.

HashClarity(i) = −(cid:88)

w∈Di

p(w|Di) × log

p(w|Di)
p(w|T)

We compute hashtag clarity for both the compounding hash-
tags #A and #B and use them individually as features.

Word diversity of the compounding hashtags
This feature tells us how much diverse are the words related
to a hashtag. If Di is the document containing all the tweets
in which hashtag i appears and p(w|Di) is the probability of
a word belonging to the document Di then word diversity of
hashtag i is deﬁned as follows

WordDiv(i) = −(cid:88)

w∈Di

p(w|Di) × log p(w|Di)

We compute word diversity of both the compounding hash-
tags #A and #B and use each of them as a feature.

Avg. topic overlap among the compounding hashtags
Topical overlap is an important aspect for a hashtag com-
pounding phenomena. More the constituent hashtags are
aligned to the similar topics, more is the chance that the hash-
tag compound becomes popular. For topic discovery from the
tweet corpus, we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [7]
model, a renowned generative probabilistic model for dis-
covery of latent topics. For a hashtag i, we consider all the
tweets in which the hashtag appears as a document for the
LDA model. Now, considering all the hashtags we experi-
ment with, we have a collection of documents on which we
run LDA to obtain the word distribution across all the topics
for each document. Next, for each of the topic, we ﬁnd top
100 words according to the belongingness probability of the
words in the topic for both #A and #B. We then compute the

57

overlap between these two sets. For each topic, we compute
topic overlap (in terms of the number of common words be-
longing to that topic) between #A and #B and consider the
average of them as a feature for the classiﬁcation model.

Table 4: Performance of various classiﬁers at different time of prediction (T
= 2, 6, 10 months) for different topic selection for LDA feature with number
of topics (K = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). The classiﬁcation results are shown for
10-fold cross validation as well as with separate training and testing set in
9:1 ratio.

User features:
Users play an important role in hashtag adoption. People
use/adopt hashtags according to their personal interest, their
social inﬂuence etc. In this subsection, we shall discuss a set
of user features which could be important for discriminating
a popular compound from an unpopular one.

Unique and common users
We hypothesize that the extent of adoption of the constituent
hashtags could be an important indicator of the overall pop-
ularity of the compound formed. For this reason, we mea-
sure the number of unique users tweeting using either of the
constituent #A or #B. These two counts act as classiﬁcation
features. In addition, we also identify the number of common
users who tweet both the constituent hashtags #A and #B ei-
ther in the same tweet or in different tweets. This is another
feature for the classiﬁcation model.

Mention behavior of the users
People tend to mention people in tweets whom they like to
engage in conversations. Thus, mention behavior in tweets
for constituent hashtags might affect adoption of the hashtag
compound. Therefore, we ﬁnd the number of unique users
mentioned in tweets containing the constituent hashtag #A.
The same is found for #B. These two act as features for the
classiﬁer. We further ﬁnd the number of common users being
mentioned either in the same or different tweets containing
both the constituent hashtags #A and #B. This is another fea-
ture for the classiﬁcation model.

Retweet behavior of the users
Retweeting is an inherent indicator of increasing popularity
of a hashtag. More retweets usually mean more popularity.
Similar to the case of mentions, we ﬁnd the number of unique
retweets for the set of tweets containing the constituent hash-
tag #A. The same goes for #B. These two act as features for
the classiﬁcation model. We thereafter ﬁnd number of com-
mon retweets using both the compounding hashtags #A and
#B. This is also a classiﬁcation feature.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we analyze the performance of our prediction
model. For prediction task, we use 2000 hashtag compounds
(#AB) whose constituent hashtags #A and #B have each oc-
curred in at least 50 tweets six months before the time point at
which the compounding took place. We use Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and logistic regression classiﬁers available
in Weka Toolkit [27] for classifying the data into popular and
unpopular hashtag compounds. We perform 10-fold cross-
validation as well as training and testing on separate dataset
by splitting the data into 9:1 (see table 4 for details). We
achieve 77.07% accuracy with high precision and recall rates
while predicting after T = 2 months. As one increases this
time period, the accuracy of prediction increases, although
not very signiﬁcantly. For long-term predictions after T =

6 months and 10 months, the accuracy obtained are 77.5%
and 79.13% respectively. Both the classiﬁers yield very sim-
ilar classiﬁcation performance; however the logistic regres-
sion model gives better area under the ROC curve compared
to SVM. We also observe that the number of topics (K) of
LDA do not have a signiﬁcant effect on the classiﬁcation re-
sults. For K = 30, we achieve the best accuracy and the area
under the ROC curve. We observe that our prediction accu-
racy improves by ∼58% over the baseline accuracy produced
by human judgment.

Ablation experiments for feature importance

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

To understand the importance of the features, we perform ab-
lation experiments by removal of various feature types. In ta-
ble 5, we present the contribution of different combinations
of feature types, demonstrating how each of these feature
types affect the classiﬁcation and whether any feature type is
masked by a stronger signal produced by other feature types.
We observe that tweet content features are the most discrim-
inative ones whereas hashtag content features are the least.
However, the combination of tweet content features with user
features and tweet content features with hashtag content fea-
tures yield very similar accuracy values.

30 and time period of observation t = 2 months.

Discriminative features
In this subsection, we discuss about the discriminative power
of the individual features. In order to determine the discrimi-
native power of each feature, we compute the chi-square (χ2)
value and the information gain. Table 6 shows the order of all
features based on the χ2 value, where larger the value, higher
is the discriminative power. The ranks of the features are very
similar when ranked by information gain (Kullback-Leibler
divergence). Among tweet content features, the most discrim-
inative features are the overlap features like n-gram overlap,
word overlap. In addition, we observe that the hashtag fea-
tures like the INV/OOV combination, POS combinations, are
also highly discriminative.

CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
In this section, we shall compare the outcomes of the auto-
matic prediction framework with the human judgment results.
We consider this correspondence analysis to be a method-
ological novelty of our work and argue that such a study can
form a crucial part of any future research of similar type.
For this purpose, we select from among the set of 2000 hash-
tags those 600 cases that have been used for the human judg-
ment experiments. This time we train the model on the 1400
(i.e, 2000 - 600) cases and test on the 600 cases (T = 6
months). We then compare the predicted labels from the auto-
matic prediction framework and the human judgment labels
decided via majority voting. In table 7, we present the re-
sults of this correspondence analysis. The number of discor-
dant cases are higher than the number of concordant cases.
We further observe that there are 211 cases where both hu-
man and automatic prediction framework correctly identify
the labels; 246 cases where the automatic prediction frame-
work is only able to identify the correct labels and humans
fail to do so; ﬁnally there are non-signiﬁcant number of cases
(only 80) where humans could correctly identify the labels
while the automatic prediction framework failed to do so. In

table 8, we attempt to present reasons behind the above ob-
servations. We ﬁnd that the human evaluators can correctly
label those cases where the hashtag compound have the high-
est frequency for the popular class and lowest for the unpop-
ular class (i.e., the relatively easier cases); on the other hand,
the automatic prediction framework can identify the popular
hashtag compounds whose frequency values are not very dif-
ferent from the constituent hashtags (i.e., a relatively harder
case).

DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we shall discuss some of the implications of
the ﬁndings from our study. The novelty of our research is
tied to the method of merging socio-linguistic features with
information technological research. We used hashtags as lin-
guistic unit. Similar to lexical compounding, hashtag com-
pounding also exhibit prominence of noun-noun compound-
ing. Unlike lexical compounds, there are several other forms
of compounding prevalent in popular hashtag compounds like
determiner-noun compound, verb-determiner compound. We

perform named entity recognition to identify which kind of
named entities merge. We observe that combinations where
both hashtags are entities, are predominantly found to be
person-person combination and product-product combination
whereas other kind of combinations are also prevalent. To
the best of our knowledge, entity combination have not been
studied in lexical compounding and hence is a novel contribu-
tion. Apart from the linguistic aspects of compounding, there
are sociological factors which mostly drive the adoption pro-
cess of compounds in communities. Due to unavailability of
large scale data, there have been no prior work on this. In our
work, we attempt to study the sociological aspects of hashtag
compounding on large-scale Twitter dataset. We observe that
mention and retweeting behavior of individuals are important
factors for popular hashtag compounding. These features ap-
pear to be highly discriminative in predicting popular hash-
tag compounds. We also compare our automatic prediction
framework with human judgment in order to justify the hard-
ness of the prediction task. The framework can guide Twitter
users in selecting the right compounds leading to a higher
gain in popularity. We also perform a correspondence anal-
ysis of human judgment and machine prediction to ﬁnd out
whether there is any inherent pattern embedded in it. We ﬁnd
that human evaluators can guess the relatively easier cases
where there are larger frequency gaps in a compound and its
constituent parts whereas the automated framework can dis-
tinguish the more tough cases.
Unlike lexical compounds where there is no/little knowledge
of how the compounding took place and the compounds be-
came popular, there are sociological inﬂuences in the for-
mation of hashtag compounds. Hashtag compounds can
be made popular artiﬁcially. For example, #AmazonPrime-
Day, #WWW2015, #KDD2015 etc. There are also sponta-
neous pressures of hashtag compound formation. These kind
of compounds are generally conversational hashtags or Id-
ioms.
Idioms actually have different spreading mechanism
as shown in [53]. They have high stickiness and low persis-
tence. In table 9, we further show the differences of these
two kinds of hashtag compounds in terms of some of their
statistical properties. The ﬁrst four compounds are examples
of Idioms ( i.e., spontaneous formation of hashtags) whereas
the remaining four are examples of forced/inﬂuenced hash-
tag compounds. We observe that in general, the spontaneous
compounds have lesser number of mentions per tweets and
lesser no. of collocations with other hashtags compared to the
forced/inﬂuenced compounds. Also, the forced hashtag com-

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we investigated various socio-linguistic prop-
erties responsible for hashtag compound formation and pro-
posed a model to early predict popular hashtag compounds.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study which
deals with hashtag compounding and its adoption at a large
scale over a very popular social media.
Our proposed prediction framework achieves a high accu-
racy of 77.07% with a high precision and recall. We ob-
serve that the tweet content features are most discriminative
compared to others. Among the tweet content features, the
overlap features like n-gram overlap and word overlap are the
most signiﬁcant ones. The baseline accuracy based on hu-
man judgment experiment is only 48.7%. This indicates that
humans are not able to predict popular compound formation
efﬁciently; in contrast, our model suitably informed with the
right set of discriminative features is able to predict the pop-
ular compounds highly accurately with an overall ∼58% im-
provement on the baseline. We also perform long term pre-
dictions after T = 6 and 10 months after compounding and
achieve 77.5% and 79.13% accuracy respectively. Correspon-
dence analysis of the results obtained from the human judg-
ments and the automatic framework shows that while the for-
mer is able to distinguish between the relatively easier cases,
the latter is more successful in classifying the harder cases.
There are quite a few other interesting directions that can be
explored in future. One such direction could be to study the
lexical compounding on large scale data available in the form
of millions of digitized books and newspaper archives. This
study, we believe, can have important contributions to many
NLP applications.
