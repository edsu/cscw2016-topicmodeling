Successful online communities (e.g., Wikipedia, Yelp, and StackOverﬂow) can produce valuable content. However, many communities fail in their initial stages. Starting an oine community is challenging because there is not enough content to attract a critical mass of active members. This paper examines methods for addressing this cold-start proem in datamining-bootstrappable communities by attracng non-members to contribute to the community. We make four contributions: 1) we characterize a set of communies that are “datamining-bootstrappable” and deﬁne the bootrapping problem in terms of decision-theoretic optimizion, 2) we estimate the model parameters in a case study involving the Open AI Resources website, 3) we demonstrate that non-members’ predicted interest levels and request dign are important features that can signiﬁcantly affect the contribution rate, and 4) we ran a simulation experiment ung data generated with the learned parameters and show that our decision-theoretic optimization algorithm can generate as much community utility when bootstrapping the community as our strongest baseline while issuing only 55% as many contribution requests.
