Within  the  CSCW  community,  little  has  been  done  to 
systematically  analyze  online  eating  disorder  (ED)  user 
generated content. In this paper, we present the results of a 
cross-platform  content  analysis  of  ED-related  posts.  We 
analyze  the  way  that  hashtags  are  used  in  ad-hoc  ED-
focused  networks  and  present  a  comprehensive  corpus  of 
ED-terminology that frequently accompanies ED activities 
online.  We  provide  exemplars  of  the  types  of  ED-related 
content  found  online.  Through  this  characterization  of 
activities,  we  draw  attention  to  the  increasingly  important 
role  that  these  platforms  play  and  how  they  are  used  and 
misappropriated  for  negative  health  purposes.  We  also 
outline  specific  challenges  associated  with  researching 
these  types  of  networks  online.  CAUTION:  This  paper 
includes  media  that  could  potentially  be  a  trigger  to  those 
dealing  with  an  eating  disorder  or  with  other  self-injury 
illnesses.  Please  use  caution  when  reading,  printing,  or 
disseminating this paper.

Eating  disorders  are  not  a  new  phenomenon.  One  of  the 
earliest documented Western cases was in the late 1370’s. It 
was  reported  Saint  Catherine  of  Siena  was  accustomed  to 
rigorous  nutritional  abstinence,  confessing  she  was  unable 
to  eat  due  to  an  ‘illness’  that  would  not  let  her  consume 
food,  with  the  exception  of  her  daily  Holy  Communion 
[37]. Eating disorders, while once viewed as an undesirable

behavior  or  behaviors  associated  with  religious  rite  and 
rituals,  are  now  seen  as  treatable  medical  illnesses,  most 
commonly  expressed  as  Anorexia  Nervosa  or  Bulimia 
Nervosa  [58].  Both  of  these  diseases,  as  well  as  eating 
disorders 
are 
characterized by a clinically unhealthy relationship to food, 
which manifests in a variety of behaviors and activities.  
It is estimated that between 10 million [61]  and 20 million 
[52]  people  suffer  from  a  clinically  significant  eating 
disorder  in  the  United  States.  Despite  the  commonality  of 
these health issues, eating disorders continue to be ignored 
and  overlooked  at  the  state  and  national  levels  [59]. 
Healthcare  professionals  and  politicians  have  begun  to 
recognize the impact of eating disorders on the populace as 
a  growing  public  health  threat  [59].  Anorexia  has  the 
highest  mortality  rate  of  any  psychiatric  disorder  [2].  A 
woman  15-24  years  old  with  anorexia  is  12  times  more 
likely  to  die  than  a  women  without  anorexia,  and  the 
frequency  of  suicide  is  75  times  greater  than  a  young 
woman without an eating disorder [49]. 
Marginalized communities and those with lifestyles that are 
not mainstream, and commonly labeled “alternative,” have 
often  found  refuge  online  [21,31,53]. 
  The  CSCW 
community has a long and rich history of examining online 
spaces  that  support  niche  or  marginalized  communities 
[15,30,55].  As  early  as  2001,  popular  news  outlets  began 
reporting on the presence of the alternative communities of 
anorexic people online [41]. With increasing access to new 
media  platforms,  individuals  with  eating  disorders  no 
longer  needed  to  meet  up  with  other  individuals  with  ED 
through  clinics  and  at  hospitals,  but  instead  were  able  to 
establish and support thriving pro- <insert eating disorder or 
issue  of  choice>  communities  online  [3].  Given  the 
preponderance of coordinated, online activity, in this work 
we  attempt  to  analyze  the  cooperative  and  computer-
mediated  activities  taking  place  within  this  population. 
While  this  online  activity  is  sometimes  described  as 
“communities  [40],”  we  take  a  more  conservative  stance 
and  characterize  collections  of  user  content  as  “networks” 
within and across media platforms [22,35]. 
In this paper we explore the dynamic relationships between 
eating disorder (ED) networks within multiple social media 
platforms.  We  present  the  results  of  a  cross-platform 

content  analysis  of  eating  disorder-related  posts  and 
characterize  these  activities  based  on  associated  hashtags 
and media. To achieve these goals, we focus on several key 
questions:  1)  How  is  ED  content  organized  within  social 
media  platforms  2)  How  do  ED  posters  represent 
themselves  in  different  online  spaces  and  what,  if  any, 
similarities exist across platforms and 3) While this analysis 
is based on the presentation of eating disorders, what other 
health issues are self-disclosed in conjunction with ED? 
Our  work  makes  several  contributions  to  the  CSCW 
community:

2.(cid:1) We  contextualize  the  presence  of  ED  presentations

Eating disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders where 
a  patient  becomes  obsessed  with  food  intake,  weight,  and 
perceived  body  image  (both  internal  and  external)  [56]. 
While Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa are the two 
of the most popularly known eating disorders, they are not 
the most common ED-related illnesses – the most common 
is    “eating  disorders  not  otherwise  specified”  or  EDNOS 
[48]  which  was  recently  reclassified  as  OSFED  or  Other 
Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders [60]. Regardless of 
classification, all eating disorders are defined by three key 
characteristics [17,60]: 
1.(cid:1) A  disturbance  of  eating  habits  or  weight-control 

behaviors 

2.(cid:1) A  clinically  significant  impairment  of  physical  health 

or psychosocial functioning 

3.(cid:1) The  behavioral  disturbance  is  not  secondary  to  any 
general  medical  disorder  or  to  any  other  psychiatric 
condition 

The motivations driving these behaviors are often complex 
to unpack – yet at its core, they focus on individuals who 
view nutrition and the process of eating as a mechanism to 
solve or camouflage problems that seem insurmountable or 
insoluble [7] or a way of dealing with levels of self-worth 
[62].  While  these  diseases  share  commonalities,  they  also 
have distinguishing characteristics specific to the individual 
illnesses. Below we briefly describe the three classifications 

1186

SESSION: MUSEUMS AND PUBLIC SPACES

of eating disorders – Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, 
and EDNOS – and detail their defining characteristics. 
(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:29)(cid:31)(cid:19)(cid:37)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:31)(cid:35)(cid:29)(cid:32)(cid:16)(cid:1)
Anorexia  Nervosa  has  four  essential  diagnostic  criteria 
outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM) [60]: 
1.(cid:1) Refusal  to  maintain  body  weight  over  minimum 

expected for age and height 
Intense fear of gaining weight 

2.(cid:1)
3.(cid:1) Disturbance  in  the  experience  of  body  weight  and 
shape,  undue  influece  of  weight  and  shape  on  self-
evaluation, or denial of seriousness of low body weight 

4.(cid:1) Amenorrhea (irregular mensturation cycles) 
(cid:4)(cid:34)(cid:26)(cid:23)(cid:27)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:31)(cid:35)(cid:29)(cid:32)(cid:16)(cid:1)
Bulimia Nervosa also has four essential diagnostic criteria 
outlined in the DSM [60]:  
1.(cid:1) Recurrent episodes of binge eating and an awareness of 

loss of control during the binging 

2.(cid:1) Recurrent  inappropriate  compensatory  behavior  to 
prevent  weight  gain  (e.g.,  self-induced  vomiting, 
laxatives, excessive exercise or fasting) 

3.(cid:1) Self  evaluation  unduly  influenced  by  body  shape  and 

weight 

4.(cid:1) Binge-eating  and  compensatory  behaviors  occurring 

twice a week for three months  

(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:1)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:36)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:1)(cid:1)
Under the new edition of the DSM, EDNOS was changed 
to  OSFED  as  mentioned  earlier.  For  the  purpose  of  this 
paper we used EDNOS, the more commonly used term in 
the  mainstream  ED-related  vocabulary.  EDNOS  is  a 
category of eating disorders that does not meet criteria for 
either Anorexia or Bulimia. OSFED has six criteria outlined 
in the DSM [60]: 
1.(cid:1) For females, all criteria for Anorexia Nervosa are met 
except  that  the  individual  has  a  regular  menstruation 
cycle 

2.(cid:1) All  the  criteria  for  Anorexia  Nervosa  are  met  except 
that,  despite  significant  weight  loss,  the  individual’s 
current weight is in the normal range. 

3.(cid:1) All the criteria for Bulimia Nervosa are met except that 
the  binge  eating  and 
inappropriate  compensatory 
mechanisms occur at a frequency of less than twice a 
week or for a duration of less than 3 months. 

4.(cid:1) The 

regular  use  of 

inappropriate  compensatory 
behavior by an individual of normal body weight after 
eating  small  amounts  of  food  (e.g.,  self-induced 
vomiting after eating small amounts of food) 

5.(cid:1) Repeatedly  chewing  and  spitting  out,  but  not 

swallowing, large amounts of food. 

6.(cid:1) Binge-eating  disorder:  recurrent  episodes  of  binge 
in  Bulimia 

typified 

eating  not  characteristically 
Nervosa. 

OSFED  should  not  be  perceived  as  a  less  serious  or  less 
severe  eating  disorder.  On  the  contrary,  the  only  reason

there  is  delineation  between  OSFED  and  Anorexia  or 
Bulimia  is  based  on  the  presentation  seen  with  the  eating 
disorder  [48].  The  classifications  have  nothing  to  do  with 
severity or potential impacts of the illness on the individual. 
(cid:9)(cid:27)(cid:44)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:33)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:35)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:42)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:42)(cid:43)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:39)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:31)(cid:1)
Individuals grappling with behaviors and activities outlined 
above utilize the Internet to connect and collaborate in the 
sharing  of  best  practices  [20],  sharing  inspirational  media 
known to the network as thinspiration [18], and connecting 
with  others  to  support  their  activities  in  a  non-judgmental 
manner  [3].  Interactions  on  these  platforms  encourage  the 
sharing  of  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  behaviors  for  the 
disorder with the broader network to amplify the destructive 
impact they have on themselves [4,18]. These networks can 
utilize  different  technologies  including  bulletin  boards, 
static websites, blogs, groups on social network sites, email 
listservs  [3],  or  more  recently  through  hashtags  within 
social media platforms as an informal, ad-hoc network [8]. 
While  a  majority  of  literature  classifies  these  groups  of 
individuals  as  communities,  we  will  refer  to  them  as 
networks  or  support  networks  as  to  not  conflate  these 
groups with the CSCW definitions of community. We use 
the term support networks not as a traditional support group 
seeking  health,  but  a  network  supporting  the  actions 
associated with the disease 
Support networks that support eating disorder activities and 
behaviors  construct  social  norms  and  customary  patterns 
that govern the group members’ activities and perceptions 
of  reality  as  reflected  through  the  collective  voice  [11]. 
Fleming  et  al.  describe  their  analysis  of  these  groups 
through 
[18].  This 
perspective allows a focus on the exchanging of knowledge 
and  practice  through  collaborative  dialogue  [51].  This 
constructivist approach to identity and network formation is 
critical in understanding how such a decentralized and fluid 
community  maintains  norms  and  a  sense  of  presence  in 
spite  of  hurdles 
like  community  censorship  and 
decentralization across multiple platforms.

One  of  the  most  seductive  charms  of  these  groups  that 
sustain  and  perpetuate  eating  disorders,  especially  those 
online, are the support mechanisms put in place that sustain 
existing members while attracting new ones. Social support

that 
influencers  in  an  individual’s  life  can  provide  positive 
social encounters and discussions that will result in changes 
in  behavior  [13].  In  typical  social  health  literature,  this 
support  is  positive  in  nature  and  focused  on  using  peer 
support  through  parents,  teachers,  or  friends  [32]  to 
encourage  behavior  change  that  is  both  positive  and 
sustained.  
A  contrast  arises  between  social  support’s  expected 
outcome  in  traditional  contexts  –  positive  impact  on  an 
individual’s ability to cope with stress [13] – and its role in

time  seeking  support  for 

ED  networks.  For  someone  with  an  eating  disorder,  not 
being in complete control of caloric intake and management 
is a primary source of stress [14]. Social support within the 
lens of an eating disorder network or group means trying to 
inspire  yourself  and  others  to  be  the  “best  anorexic”  or 
“best bulimic” person you can be [42]. 
(cid:22)(cid:31)(cid:37)(cid:32)(cid:4)(cid:20)(cid:42)(cid:31)(cid:43)(cid:31)(cid:39)(cid:44)(cid:27)(cid:44)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:1)
Online  spaces  allow  people  suffering  from  various  issues 
such  as  depression  [44],  sexual  abuse  [34],  and  eating 
disorders [54] the ability to self-disclose aspects of personal 
identity  or  behaviors  associated  with  issues  while  at  the 
same 
them.  For  example, 
participants of suicide-focused Internet forums often situate 
their participation as not just a “cry for help” but as part of 
their  identity  [24].  Online  forums  allow  these  identities  to 
be  tried  out,  expressed,  and  validated  [24].  To  engender 
what  they  hope  is  seen  as  an  authentic  self-presentation, 
participants  often  consider  audiences  when  constructing 
their  narratives  about  depression  and  how  and  when  it 
started [27,28]. The use of these online forums for sharing 
has also been viewed as a type of identity performance; for 
example, in the context of self-harm, the self-harmed body 
becomes a site of intersecting discourses [45]. 
These  presentations  often  take  place  in  online  spaces  not 
specifically  dedicated  nor  designed  for  such  sensitive 
disclosures.  Andalibi  et  al.  looked  into  depression-related 
images  and  captions  on  Instagram  and  found  that  people 
often  disclose  personal  narratives  and  stories,  negative 
affect,  and  self-appearance  concerns,  and  seek  social 
contact  [1].  In  the  context  of  expressions  of  loneliness, 
Kirvan-Swaine  et  al.  found  that  Twitter  expressions  of

The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  understand  the  various 
presentations  of  eating  disorders  across  several  popular 
social  media  platforms.  While  people  do  not  fully  exhibit 
the entire range of their ED-related activities through their 
online presentation, the insights obtained by analyzing the 
activities  and  behaviors  that  are  shared  on  social  media 
provide a rich contextualization and understanding into an 
often-overlooked population. 
(cid:17)(cid:9)(cid:23)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:8)(cid:22)(cid:1)
In this study, we chose  to  investigate ED activities within 
the popular social media platforms Twitter, Instagram, and 
Tumblr.  These  sites  were  chosen  based  on  their  pervasive 
use within the 13-24 age demographic [39]. To achieve our 
research  objective  of  characterizing  ED  support  networks 
online, we first did an investigative search across platforms 
to  establish  an  ED-based  dictionary  of  terms.  We  then 
collected  posts  and  established  a  codebook  for  both  the 
hashtags associated with the posts as well as a codebook for

To  begin,  we  researched  the  terminology  associated  with 

Image 1.  Exemplar post from dataset 

general  eating  disorders  and,  more  specifically,  with 
Anorexia and Bulimia. Based on a review of the literature 
[46]  and  popular  online  eating  disorder  forums,  we 
established an initial set of search terms, Ti (see Table 1).  
Using  the  Ti  corpus,  we  conducted  an  initial  search  of  50 
posts for each term on Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram – the 
platforms analyzed for this this study – yielding a dataset of 
800 posts. This dataset had fewer posts than anticipated for 
several  reasons.  The  hashtag  convention  within  ED 
communities does not use hyphens, thus we removed “pro-
ana” and  “pro-mia” from  use.  In  addition,  Instagram  has 
blocked  the  terms  “proana”  and  “promia”  from  use.  The 
hashtag “proED” was also removed due to a lack of use by 
ED support networks – this hashtag is widely used by the 
higher education community.  Because of these limitations, 
we collected no data on the “proed,” “pro-ana,” and “pro-
mia” tags nor did we collect data from Instagram using the 
“proana” or “promia” tags.  
Using this set of 800 posts, we identified the most relevant

platforms. Because each platform has different policies and 
technical affordances, conducting a one-to-one comparison 
would not be a truly fair representation of the prevalence of 
the hashtags within that platform. Several terms were added 
to the initial corpus based on this analysis (See Table 1) to 
create our revised corpus, Tr. 
(cid:8)(cid:27)(cid:44)(cid:27)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:37)(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:44)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:1)
Using  the  search  terms  within  the  Tr  corpus,  we  collected 
data  between  April  27  and  May  8,  2015  from  Twitter, 
Tumblr,  and  Instagram.  We  collected  only  public  posts  in 
the  English  language.  We  also  gathered  all  hashtags 
attached  to  the  post,  the  body  of  text  associated  with  the 
post,  and  any  attached  media  (image,  video,  gif).  We 
noticed  that  several  posts  were  repeated  across  platforms 
both  formally  (e.g.,  linking  to  an  Instagram  post  on  a 
Tweet)  and  informally  (e.g.,  similar  images  and  language 
being  used  by  different  account  names  on  different 
platforms).  To  deal  with  this  potential  cross  sampling,  we 
chose to randomly sample the data for our final data pool. 
While this strategy does not eliminate the potential for cross 
sampling,  it  diminishes  the  likelihood  of  cross  sampling 
within our data. In total, we analyzed 575 posts.  
(cid:7)(cid:40)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:28)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:36)(cid:1)(cid:50)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:27)(cid:43)(cid:34)(cid:44)(cid:27)(cid:33)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:39)(cid:27)(cid:37)(cid:49)(cid:43)(cid:35)(cid:43)(cid:1)
We  created  a  small  classification  codebook  for 
the 
hashtags.  We  again  employed  an  inductive  approach  to 
analyze the 6705 total hashtags collected from the posts in 
our  dataset,  of  which  1182  were  unique.  While  some  of 
these  codes  are  similar  to  the  media  analysis  (see  below), 
some are unique. We used the following categories:  
Anorexia
Body 
Bulimia 
Depression/Sadness  Mental Health 
Fitness

researchers 
independently  open  coded  a  randomized  7%  sample  (40 
posts)  of  media  attached  to  collected  posts.  We  coded  for 
general themes. Next, we met as a group to discuss themes 
and further refine the coding taxonomy.  The team reached 
an inter-rater reliability of 86%. Table 2 below depicts the 
final codebook used for this analysis.

The  data  collected  in  this  research  focused  on  two  main 
components  –  hashtags  and  media.  We  analyze  specific 
hashtags  and  their  presence  across  platforms,  synthesize 
these  terms  into  a  corpus,  provide  a  categorization  of  the 
corpus,  and  detail  temporal  trends  associated  with  certain 
terms. Next, our media analysis resulted in categorization of 
the  media  associated  with  the  posts,  and  highlighted  the

hashtag(s).  Findings  uncover  important  social  engineering 
practices  that  users  employ  to  circumvent  censorship  on 
social  media  platforms.  Finally,  we  analyzed  the  different 
health-related issues that users self-disclosed in our dataset.

We  analyze  the  presence  of  hashtags  used  in  ED-related 
social  media  content,  and  provide  a  corpus  and 
categorization  of  these  hashtags.  A  total  of  6705  hashtags 
were attached to the 575 posts in our data set. On average, 
there were 11.7 tags attached to each post (SD = 9.0; range 
1-33).  Table  3  below  highlights  the  breakdown  of  these 
numbers  per  platform,  since  there  are  differences  between 
each with respect to the affordances of each site.

the 

terminology  associated  with 

It  should  be  noted  that  several  terms  found  within  certain 
categories  are  used  by  other  categories  as  well  –  for 
example, 
struggle 
associated  with  the  disease  like  “warrior,”  “fighter,”  and 
“soldier”  occurred  in  both  pro-disease  and  pro-recovery 
categories. For purposes of this categorization schema, we 
focused on the ED component attached to the tag.  
Table 4 highlights and defines the categories used to set up 
the  ED  vocabulary  corpus  (Table  5).  Previous  analysis  of 
ED  activities  online  have  analyzed  categories  associated 

with  thinspiration,  recovery,  control,  perceived  harm  [4], 
and social support [46]. Our analysis includes other mental 
illnesses as well as an explicit, more detailed analysis of the 
specific eating disorders Anorexia and Bulimia. 
 
Anorexia  (15.0%):  All 
terms  associated  specifically  with 
Anorexia are captured in this category. More specifically, all terms 
contain some form of “ana” within the term.  
Bulimia  (9.5%):  All  terms  associated  specifically  with  Bulimia 
are captured in this category. Unlike Anorexia, this category also 
includes central behaviors and activities crucial to the disease of 
bulimia like binging and purging. 
General  Eating  Disorders  (ED)  (8.9%):  Disease-focused  eating 
disorder  tags  not  captured  through  the  Anorexia  or  Bulimia 
categories.  These  ranged  from  more  formal  classifications  to 
activities that comprise these specific activities.  
Body (4.0%): This category encompasses all terms associated with 
anatomical parts of the human body. 
Depression/Sadness  (4.0%):  Emotional  terms  associated  with 
sadness, depression, or behaviors associated with these sentiments. 
These sentiments could be reflective of oneself, the community, or 
the world. 
Fitness  (0.9%):  Activity  terms  focused  on  the  act  of  physical 
exertion or identity makers of a fit person/group. 
Food  (3.4%):  Food  and  beverage-related  terminology  as  well  as 
diets  and  terms  associated  with  feelings  linked  to  deprivation  of 
food. 
Identity (3.3%): Identity tags ranged from internal perceptions of 
self, to classifications of being, to characterizations of identity. 
Inspiration  (7.4%):  Terms  associated  with  disease-specific 
support and other forms of empowerment. 
Mental Health (3.3%): Co-occurrences with other mental health 
illnesses  like  bipolar  and  anxiety  in  addition  to  general  mental 
health terms and health status.  
Recovery/Treatment  (5.1%):  Classifications  of  professional  and 
non-professional assistance or help in battling eating related issue. 
Self-Injury (7.1%): Self-injury or self-harm terms associated with 
self-mutilation and tools used for these activities. 
Social  Support  (1.7%):  Support  for  eating  disorder  behaviors 
from  the  support  network  online.  Some  might  seem  counter-
intuitive because they focus on using terms like bully and shame 
to support them when they falter in maintaining characteristics of 
the disease.  
Suicide/Death (5.2%): Explicit and implicit suicidal ideation and 
the tools used for the acts. Also included feelings associated with 
death.  
Weight (7.6%): Direct individual weights, perceptions of weight, 
and  the  process  of  losing/gaining  weight  are  included  in  this 
category.

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

Based on the categorizations derived from the tags, Table 5 
displays the full corpus of Eating Disorder hashtags found 
within our dataset. The corpus is divided into direct eating 
disorder  tags  and  activities  or  states  of  being  that  support 
eating  disorders.  Unlike  other  studies  focused  on  online 
eating  disorder  websites  [4,6,18,46],  we  present  the  full 
range of lexical variations associated with the posts in our 
dataset.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  largest  and  most 
diverse  terminology  corpus  focused  on  eating  disorder 
behaviors  and  activities  within  the  health  and  social 
computing domains. 
The  terms  found  within  the  corpus  span  from  traditional 
terms like “anorexia” and “thinspiration” to more modified 
terms  like  “anorectic”  and  “thynspo”.  Table  6  highlights 
exmaples  of  these  transitions  from  traditional  to  modified 
terms for Anorexia and Thinspiration. We noticed that the 
same  evolutions  took  place  irregardless  of  the  platform 
where  the  post  originated.  These  shifts  can  be  related  to 
changes  in  moderation  policies  [10],  technical  affordances 
[25], and more traditional permutations represented through 
slang derivations [38]. While understanding the motivations 
behind  these  shifts  is  out  of  scope  for  this  analysis, 
highlighting  these  patterns  is  an  important  contribution  of 
characterizing ED-related social media behaviors and points 
to important future work.

In our dataset, 59.5% of the images contained one or more 
individuals.  We  coded  these  images  for  the  types  of  body 
parts  that  were  the  focus  or  most  prevalent.  In  total  we 
coded for ten body parts. Overall, the posts averaged 1.70 
body  parts  per  image  (SD  =  1.22).  Table  8  highlights  the 
percentage of images that had a prominent body part, taking 
into  consideration  that  images  could  have  more  than  one 
prominent body part represented.

gender presentation and identifiability. These were coded as 
feminine  (61.0%),  masculine  (5.9%),  or  unknown/other 
(33.1%). Image 2 below shows a representation of each of 
these  categories.  Regarding  identifiability,  79.6%  were 
unidentifiable,  meaning

Just  over  half,  54.1%,  of  images  had  text  associated  with 
the image. When we analyzed the text to better understand 
its  purpose  in  association  with  the  image,  we  identified 
three categories associated with the sentiments shared. Text 
that  embodied  sentiments  supporting  illness  was  found  in 
21.2%  of  the  total  dataset.  For  example,  “Do  not  reward 
yourself  with  food…you’re  not  a  dog”  and  “I  wish  my 
bones  showed  like  this”  exemplify  sentiments  shared  that 
support  behaviors  associated  with  eating  disorders.  Text 
that embodied sentiments supporting recovery was found in 
6.1%  of  the  total  dataset.  “I  ate  so  well  today,  I  am  so 
proud!” and “Repost to save a life – eating disorder hotline:

Here we describe the results of the analysis we conducted 
on  the  media  components  of  the  posts  in  our  dataset.  We 
begin  by  describing  content  analysis  results  and  then 
present discussion of the archetypes that were deduced from 
our  findings.  These  archetypes,  while  not  exhaustive,  are 
representative of ED support networks. Out of the 575 posts 
in our dataset, 553 had images - 22 of the Twitter posts in 
the  dataset  did  not  have  a  piece  of  media  attached  to  the 
post.

We  did  a  general  analysis  of image  characteristics. Black 
and white images comprised 54.1% of our data set with the 
rest  being  comprised  of  color-saturated  images.  Table  7

text  shared  demonstrating 
recovery  or  support  to  transition  into  recovery.  The  third 
and  last  category  of  text  embedded  in  images  was  candid 
statements.  Examples  from  this  category  include  “Easily 
forgotten  because  I  don’t  matter”  and  “I  hate  the  feeling 
when you randomly feel depressed…there’s no warning, no 
apparent reason. It just happens.”

Our analysis of the media posted on these social platforms 
also identified certain archetypes related to ED posts. While 
all media did not fall into one of these foci, the following 
are representative of a majority of posts within our dataset.  
(cid:15)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:23)(cid:31)(cid:16)(cid:33)(cid:23)(cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:1)
Posts  in  this  category  offer  inspiration  to  both  themselves 
(individual)  as  well  as  others  within  the  network  (others). 
Thinspiration  or  “thinspo”  are  media 
that  encourage 
individuals to be as thin as possible.  Image 3 is an example 
of thinspiration rated to activities or negative reinforcement.
Another  category  of  thinspiration  is  images  of  individuals 

Image 3. Thinspiration images - activities 

and  body  parts  to  encourage  individuals  to  strive  for  the 
“ideal”  body  type.  This  category  includes  “bonespiration” 
or “bonespo”, characterized by the ability to see as many of 
your  bones  through  your  skin  as  possible.  Image  4  is  an 
example of these types of media.

(cid:6)(cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:33)(cid:1)
Foods and drinks are a central tenet for eating disorders in 
practice  and  in  diagnosis.  They  are  also  used  to  evoke 
sentiments  of  social  support  and  the  sharing  of  best 
practices.  Image  7  highlights  the  types  of  images  in  the 
dataset  shared  as  part  of  a  “balanced  meal”  or  support  to 
avoid consuming calories.

For images within the mismatches archetype, the image and 
the associated hashtags are the antithesis of each other. This 
strategy  could  be  implemented  by  the  user  to  circumvent 
the censorship technologies employed by the social media 
platforms; it could be a strategy to impact large swathes of 
“wannabes” or those on the periphery of the network; or it 
could be an attempt to communicate actions and behaviors

Before-and-after compilations are a way for individuals to 
share  progress  and  are  likely  used  by  the  creator  as 
motivation to “keep going” in their pursuit of the ideal body 
type. Media in this category focus on the journey associated

to  the  network  without  using  media  that  could  potentially 
trigger or deeply affect other individuals. 
If analysis only took place using the post text, void of the 
tags  or  images,  some  posts  would  show  no  indication  of 
being a potential trigger. Image 8 was taken from Twitter. 
The  associated  post  stated  “Thank  you  for  100  followers. 
Lovely  people!”  The  associated  hashtags  are  “thinspo,” 
“ily,”  “skinny,”  “anamia,”  and  “ed.”  There  is  clearly  a 
mismatch between the tone of the post text and the hashtags 
associated with the post. While the hashtags and the media 
are  synergistc,  there  is  a  definite  mismatch  with  the 
attached  post  text.  We  saw  many  examples  of  these  a 
certain number of followers or a post got a certain amount

to evade filters is tagging posts in the comments of the post 
instead of in the actual post itself. This is a relatively new 
phenomenon

Another example is taken from Instagram (Image 9). Again, 
there is a mismatch between the focus of the post text and 
the focus of the image and associated hashtags. The text of 
the  post  stated  “Erg!  I  gotta  pee  again!  (U  didn’t  need  2 
know  that,  didyou?)”.  This  is  less  connected  than  the 
previous  example.  The  hashtags  associated  with  this  post 
include  “ana,”  “anorexia,”  “anorexic,”  “skinny,”  “thin,” 
“anamia,” “mia,” and “bulimia.” The post includes the text 
“Do not give up what you want the most for what you want 
at  the  moment.”  Again,  the  hashtag  and  media  are 
synergistic, yet the post text is an almost redirect from the 
content.

Another  popular  form  of  media  associated  with  suicidal 
ideation  or  death  is  portrayal  of  the  act  of  a  death  or 
showcase of a tool that one would use to cause death. Image 
11 depicts examples of these presentations.

Media  representing  self-injury  behaviors  such  as  cutting 
and bruising were also found in our dataset. These images 
(Image 12) were connected to sentiments of depression and 
selfhate.

One  explanation  for  these  types  of  posts  is  an  attempt  by 
the poster to “beat the filter.” Instagram heavily moderates 
hashtags and content within its community. These types of 
posts serve as an example of the social engineering within 
the  network  in  order  to  contribute  content  while  evading

Eating  disorders  do  not  happen  in  isolation  of  other 
behavioral,  mental  health  or  emotional  health  stressors  or 
illnesses.  Through  the  data  analysis  we  found  strong 
evidence  supporting  the  idea  that  depression  is  a  common 
mental  health  issue  that  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to 
decouple  from  the  presentation  of  bulimia,  anorexia,  or 
EDNOS. Within the 575 posts, 40.6% of the posts reported 
a co-occurrence of Depression.

Depression  was  not  the  only  mental  or  behavioral  health 
issue  uncovered  through  this  analysis.  Anxiety,  Bipolar, 
PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, OCD, and Paranoia 
were the more popular of the co-occurring issues other than 
depression.  Terms  associated  with  behavioral  and  mental 
health  issues  –  excluding  depression  –  were  found  within 
18.9% of all posts in our dataset.

In  this  work,  we  analyzed  hashtags  and  media  associated 
with  ED-related  posts  on  Tumblr,  Instagram,  and  Twitter. 
We  contribute  a  corpus  and  categorization  of  ED-related 
hashtags,  a  categorization  of  different  archetypes  of  ED-
related  media,  and  analysis  of  the  nuanced  relationships 
between  images,  text,  and  hashtags.  We  also  provide 
evidence  of  ED’s  co-occurrence  with  other  health  issues, 
such as depression, as disclosed by users on social media.

The process of self-presentation of ED-related activities on 
social media platforms is not a simple, straightforward task. 
ED  behaviors  are  actively  censored  on  social  media.  Our 
results  indicate  that  ED  support  networks  use  social 
engineering to circumvent the censorship. We then shift the 
discussion  to  focus  on  the  relevance  of  our  findings  and 
typical mental health screening tools, highlighting the need 
for  future  work  to  connect  and  correlate  these  indicators. 
Finally  we  discuss  the  impacts  that  technology  and 
electronic-based  activities  have  on  an  individual’s  ED-
related behaviors, understanding that these online behaviors 
represent real, and potentially deadly, health risks.. 
(cid:7)(cid:31)(cid:39)(cid:43)(cid:40)(cid:42)(cid:43)(cid:34)(cid:35)(cid:41)(cid:1)
Content  that  is  deemed  “deviant”,  “disruptive”  or  against 
community standards has a history of being censored, either 
by  the  platforms  or  the  ISPs  that  host  the  material  [6,46]. 
More  recently,  platforms  have  increasingly  begun  using 
sophisticated 
filtering  algorithms  and  crowd-sourced 
content  management  (e.g.,  the  reporting  function  on  most 
social  networks)  to  ensure  that  community  standards  and 
norms  are  upheld.  Image  13  depicts  the  message  that  an 
individual  receives  if  they  search  on  a  known  “pro-ED” 
hashtag on Tumblr. 
Members of ED networks and have raised concerns that the 
Pro-ana  and  Pro-mia  communities  are  unjustly  targeted  in 
terns  of  censorship.  Shade  explored  this  tension,  asking 
whether  communities  advocating 
for  body 
acceptance  for  the  overweight  would  be  subject  to  the 
levels  of  censure  that  Pro-ana  and  Pro-mia  communities 
currently  manage  [46].  Shade  also  argued  that  individuals 
are  not  forced  to  become  members  of  these  groups  and 
share the same ideals, and questions whether public harm is 
actually taking place [42]. In response to these concerns of 
censorship,  examples  of  social  engineering  have  begun 
appearing within ED-related posts and we expand upon this 
further below.

Putting aside the debate of whether ED is a public harm or 
not,  even  if  we  as  a  society  decided  censorship  of  these 
communities was appropriate, there is no national (US) or 
international enforceable legislation that could be effective 
in  this  domain  [12].  Because  the  Internet  is  a  global 
phenomenon,  and  does  not  belong  to  any  one  country  or 
entity, the influence of legislation is immaterial. Even if all 
of these challenges were surmountable and treatment of ED 
via censorship was deemed a need within society, in the end 
these  individuals,  who  are  already  dealing  with  physical, 
mental  and  behavioral  health  problems,  would  be  further 
marginalized through the act of being labeled as criminals 
as  well.  This  raises  the  question  of  how  effective  is 
censorship of these networks within these online platforms? 
And, potentially an even more important question, does this 
form  of  censorship  do  more  harm  than  good  for  those 
struggling  with  the  these  diseases?  Future  research  is 
needed  within  this  domain  to  tease  out  answers  or 
indicators to these important questions. 
(cid:14)(cid:29)(cid:17)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:26)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:31)(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:23)(cid:33)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:28)(cid:1)(cid:33)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:19)(cid:33)(cid:36)(cid:29)(cid:31)(cid:25)(cid:1)
In  media  and  hashtag  analysis,  we  uncovered  initial 
pointers  of  social  engineering  within  the  network  to 
circumvent  platform  regulations  and  norms.  Within  the 
corpus that we discussed previously (see Table 5) there are 
several  lexical  variations  associated  with  the  ED-specific 
terms.  These  types  of  classifications  found  within  the 
support  network  are  human  nature  –  individuals  will 
inevitably seek ways to classify things they care about even 
when  the  formal  system  of  doing  so  is  taken  away  [5]. 
While  some  of  these  modifications  and  evolutions  can  be 
explained through the evolution of slang derivations to the 
language  [38],  some  modifications  are  not  as  easily 
explained.  One  potential  explanation  is  the  network’s 
reaction  to  censorship.  When  a  platform  bans  a  hashtag, 
there  is  evidence  [10]  that  there  is  an  almost  immediate 

CSCW '16, FEBRUARY 27–MARCH2, 2016, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA

organic  response  via  slight  modifications  to  that  term,  i.e. 
“proana” and “proanaaaa” or “thinspo” and “thinspoooo”.  
Additionally,  post  composition  was  the  other  component 
where  we  witnessed  members  of  the  ED  network  socially 
engineering  ways  to  overcome  censorship.  In  Instagram 
data we witnessed a unique phenomenon that may attribute 
to  this  cause.  Hashtags  were  not  attached  to  the  original 
post,  yet  were  included  in  an  immediate  comment  on  the 
original post by the author. The Image 14 is a post from the 
dataset that exemplifies this activity.

Another example of social engineering to evade censorship 
was  uncovered  through  our  media  analysis  of  the  dataset. 
The idea of post text, hashtags, and media associated with 
the post representing a “mismatch” is intriguing because it 
raises an important question – why is this necessary? One 
explanation  why  a  post  author  may  deem  mismatching 
necessary  could  be  because  they  had  previously  been 
censored or had posts removed from the platform, and feel 
this method will keep them from being found. 
Understanding 
social 
the  motivations  behind 
engineering  practices  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this  research, 
but  is  an  interesting  vein  of  inquiry  moving  forward  as 
scholars continue to research these networks of individuals. 
(cid:13)(cid:39)(cid:32)(cid:40)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:33)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:35)(cid:27)(cid:33)(cid:39)(cid:40)(cid:43)(cid:44)(cid:35)(cid:29)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:40)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:43)(cid:1)
When  a  patient  presents  with  a  health  issue  that  signals  a 
suspected  eating  disorder,  a  number  of  eating  disorder-
focused screeners can be employed while that individual is 
being  triaged.  Technology  use,  behaviors  associated  with 
technology use, and the role of online peer influence in ED 
behaviors are not assessed or even acknowledged by these 
diagnostic tools [19,57].
Social media ED behaviors are similar to the behaviors that 
ED  screeners  aim  to  uncover:  information  associated  with 
diet,  influences,  and  the  journey  to  becoming  thin  are  all 
assessed  through  these  tools.  These  also  represent  half  of 
the  archetypes  found  within  our  media  analysis.  This 
connection  represents  just  one  indicator  that  a  person’s 

1195

online  presentation  of  ED  behaviors  and  activities  has 
relevance to and value for current in-practice diagnostics.  
If the healthcare community is not rigorously assessing the 
level  of  interconnectedness  between  these  offline  and 
online pressures, recovery may be a more difficult process 
than  it  could  be.  By  connecting  and  addressing  issues 
ascertained  through  both  online  and  offline  ED  support 
network  participation,  reductions 
in  recidivism  could 
potentially be realized because patients are better equipped 
to  re-enter  all  aspects  of  society  which  encompasses  both 
online  and  offline  activities.  How  can  our  research 
profession  help  bridge  this  divide  between  the  human-
centered  computing  field  and  the  mental  and  behavioral 
health  providers?  Developing  social  media-based  ED-
related  heuristics  that  may  allow  for  more  holistic  ED 
diagnosis and treatment, as we do in this paper, is a starting 
point. 
Designing  clinically  based  diagnostic  tools  directly  into 
online communities could have real therapeutic and clinical 
value.  Users  that  potentially  present  with  these  types  of 
issues  or  those  that  are  at  risk  for  developing  ED-related 
behaviors  could  be  identified  at  the  point  of  expression. 
However,  if  the  current  practice  of  censorship  continues 
within online platforms, it could make realizing this type of 
design  near  impossible  because  of  the  social  engineering 
techniques that continue to alter or change the presentation 
of  the  behaviors  within  the  platforms  in  response  to  the 
censorship.  This 
tension  makes  collaborations  with 
healthcare  providers  and  the  development  of  enhanced 
diagnostic  tools  critical  to  effective  interventions  and 
treatment. 
(cid:23)(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:34)(cid:39)(cid:40)(cid:37)(cid:40)(cid:33)(cid:35)(cid:29)(cid:27)(cid:37)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:39)(cid:32)(cid:37)(cid:45)(cid:31)(cid:39)(cid:29)(cid:31)(cid:43)(cid:1)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:6)(cid:31)(cid:34)(cid:27)(cid:46)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:42)(cid:43)(cid:1)
The  rapid  development  of  ICT  and  personal  computing 
technologies has exponentially increased the sheer numbers 
of people who are connected through online channels. We 
as  researchers  can  learn  from  previous  behavioral  issues 
and  how  we  as  a  society  learned  to  negotiate  technology 
and practice. Cyberbullying is a quintessential example of a 
how  a  traditional  behavioral  issue  –  bullying  –  witnessed 
changes  in  the  presentation,  penetration,  and  impact  of 
associated activities because of the insertion of technology 
into  the  bullying  process  [9].  Prior  to  the  introduction  of 
new forms of bullying afforded by technological platforms, 
bullying  had  not  traditionally  been  seen  as  a  societal 
“problem,” and was instead accepted as a fundamental and 
normal  aspect  of  childhood  [29].  Other  domains  such  as 
stalking  [47],  domestic  partner  abuse  [16],  and  gaming 
addiction  [36]  have  also  shown  evidence  of  increased 
severity and change in presentation after the introduction of 
technology. 
The consequences of injecting technology into a behavioral 
issues  such  as  bullying  or  ED  have  the  potential  to 
drastically  change  the  scope  and  consequences  of  these 
activities  due  to  several  factors:  the  size  of  the  audience 
increases, the ability to detach from the activity decreases, 

and the artifacts from the activities persist online for those 
involved  and  others  to  re-digest  at  any  given  time.  Initial 
research into these changes in the context of cyberbullying 
showed that technology-mediated activities potentially have 
more  dire  consequences  than  traditional  presentations  of 
those same activities [9].   
Multiple  strategies  have  been  put  in  place  to  address 
cyberbullying: 
the  development  of  anti-cyberbullying 
intervention  prevention  programs,  mandatory  reporting 
laws,  and  government-mandated  protocols  [23].  Other 
strategies have included creating public-private partnerships 
between  the  government  and  mobile  phone  providers  like 
that seen with Vodafone and the NetSafe program in New 
Zealand. In this partnership, if an individual is found to be a 
repeat  cyberbully,  they  can  have  their  service  temporarily 
interrupted or even have their accounts deactivated [63].  
While some of these interventions might not be applicable 
when appropriated for addressing online ED-networks, they 
represent  an  integral  step  -  multiple  stakeholders  coming 
together to develop strategies for addressing the issues ED 
posters  are  at  risk  for  harm  to  themselves  while  they  are 
encouraging  harm  to  members  of  their  network.  What  is 
likely  is  that  the  pervasive  access  to  online  content  is 
amplifying  their  reach  and  perhaps  their  offline,  harmful 
behavior. 
Much  as  technology  has  changed  what  it  means  to  be 
bullied,  we  show  in  this  work  some  of  the  ways  that 
technologies,  and 
form  on 
technological  platforms,  mediate  and  potentially  have 
changed what it means to have an eating disorder. We can 
learn from the evolution of bullying into cyberbullying and 
apply similar coping strategies to the online behaviors that 
support eating disorders. .

Research  in  this  domain  faces  several  challenges.  The 
challenges are not unique only to this vein of scholarship, 
yet  apply  to  many  other  subfields  that  are  concerned  with 
attempts at making sense from people’s digital footprints be 
it social media posts, technology utilization, or other facets 
of their digital lives. 
Our research presented in this paper has several important 
limitations. Earlier in the paper, we discussed the changing 
nature of terminology. We can speculate as to motivations 
and  drivers,  but  the  methodology  limits  the  understanding 
of the deeper cultural contexts. If we were to use a mixed 
methods  approach  and  were  able  to  interview  individuals 
immersed in these communities, we could potentially have 
uncovered  evidence  as  to  why  this  phenomenon  is  taking 
place. Without this contextual validation, we are limited to 
our  ability  to  speculate  and  conjecture  correlations  and 
causations related to what is driving these behavioral shifts. 
The  research  team  members  are  all  outsiders  to  this 
community  –  no  one  self-disclosed

addition, physicians, domain experts, and people who have 
survived  any  of  these  issues  were  not  consulted  in  the 
analysis of this data. Future research in this direction should 
include these perspectives 
(cid:8)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:51)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:27)(cid:36)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:27)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:27)(cid:29)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:37)(cid:45)(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:50)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:44)(cid:31)(cid:48)(cid:44)(cid:1)(cid:35)(cid:43)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:38)(cid:41)(cid:40)(cid:42)(cid:44)(cid:27)(cid:39)(cid:44)(cid:2)(cid:1)
On its own, analysis of hashtags was sometimes insufficient 
or  misleading  in  relation  to  the  tone  and  sentiment  of  an 
entire  post.  Terms  within  the  Social  Support,  Inspiration, 
Identity, and Food/Eating categories in particular were not 
well-aligned with whether they supported disease, recovery, 
or  neutral.  Terms  are  shared  between  these  communities 
with 
therefore  many  have 
become increasingly general in nature. 
“I’m  fine”  or  “bodypositive”  are  terms  that  we  saw 
represented  in  both  pro-disease  and  pro-recovery  posts. 
Without the context of the associated media or post content 
one could deduce or categorize these as pro-recovery terms. 
In actuality, the terms are used both to justify the normalcy 
of the diseased behavior as well as signal representation of 
the recovery process. 
Additionally, hashtag or individual post analysis often does 
not  take  into  account  responses  from  others  (such  as 
comments  or  retweets)  and  the  social  ecosystem  that 
evolves  around  social  media  content.  A  post’s  social 
surroundings  may  uncover  meaning  that  would  be  missed 
by looking at the post in isolation.    
This  observation  calls  into  question  what  we  can  really 
learn  from  analyzing  certain  elements  of  online  posts  in 
isolation, not only in the context of ED populations, but in 
online  media  research  more  broadly.  If  we  think  of  an 
individual  post  as  a  small  ecosystem,  then  the  sum  of  the 
individual parts of that post is greater than those individual 
elements. By only analyzing some parts, we are potentially 
incorrectly analyzing the intentions or actual presentations 
of 
thus  potentially  misrepresenting 
marginalized online communities.  
(cid:12)(cid:35)(cid:30)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:33)(cid:1)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:20)(cid:37)(cid:27)(cid:35)(cid:39)(cid:1)(cid:22)(cid:35)(cid:33)(cid:34)(cid:44)(cid:1)
In  the  early  days  of  the  Internet,  eating  disorder  networks 
typically organized around bulletin boards, chat rooms, and 
specific  websites 
facing 
platforms  that  were  characterized  by  group  activities  and 
organization.  Therefore,  it  was  much  easier  for  these 
networks  to  be  discovered  and  for  their  activities  to  be 
halted, which typically happened when the ISP shut down 
access  to  the  webpage  or  the  platforms;  Yahoo!,  for 
instance, could shut down certain chat rooms [46].  
Social  media  platforms  have  moved  the  scope  of  network 
construction from the group to the individual. Instead of a 
formal chat room or bulletin board, ED network members 
use  their  personal  social  media  feeds  to  connect  with  the, 
now  distributed,  ED  support  network(s).  The  uniting 
threads  within  a  singular  platform  or  across  multiple 
platforms  are  hashtags.  By  moving  to  this  organizational 
structure, these networks are able to “hide in plain sight” on

popular  social  media  platforms  like  those  analyzed  in  this 
study.  This  fluid,  individualized  presentation,  can  make 
researching  these  populations,  and  potentially  deploying 
interventions, difficult.  
(cid:9)(cid:44)(cid:34)(cid:35)(cid:29)(cid:27)(cid:37)(cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:43)(cid:35)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:42)(cid:27)(cid:44)(cid:35)(cid:40)(cid:39)(cid:43)(cid:1)
When  conducting  research  with  marginalized  online 
communities, we as researchers have attempted to keep in 
mind our own group memberships, identities, and potential 
lack  of  knowledge  about 
that  group’s  experiences, 
challenges, and values. We collected this data without user 
knowledge or consent – an accepted practice when dealing 
with public data. Thus, this research may misrepresent the 
behaviors, challenges, or identities of the study population, 
and  our  methods  do  not  allow  us  to  clarify  potential 
misrepresentations.  Additionally,  the  social  media  activity 
that we use for our analysis is unable to capture the many 
complexities  and  nuances  of  human  behavior  [43,50].  We 
note  the  ethical  limitations  of  conducting  this  research 
without consent or input from the people who generated the 
data.  Future  research  would  benefit  from  a  collaborative 
approach with members of online communities of interest. 
In  the  abstract  and  introduction  of  this  paper,  we  inserted  
“trigger  warnings”  for  the  reader;  alerting  them  to  the 
potential  negative  impacts  that  engaging  with  this  paper 
might  have  on  them.  We  feel  this  is  a  practice  that  those 
wanting  to  work  in  this  domain,  or  other  domains  where 
readers might potentially be triggered or adversely affected 
by engaging with the content, should adopt. 
All data that we collected for our analysis was public data. 
By definition (and as we have seen through practice), there 
is no consent for use required from those that post the data 
to public streams. There is a fundamental assumption to this 
practice  –  that  those  publishing  to  the  public  domain 
understand  or  have 
to  fully 
comprehend  the  ramifications  of  this  choice.  We  reached 
out  to  the  account  owners  of  all  images  used  within  this 
paper. We were intrigued to see if we were told not to use 
these  images.  We  reached  out  to  the  17  accounts  from 
which  these  images  were  taken:  3  explicitly  gave  us 
permission  to  use  them  and  14  never  responded.  Because 
we were not explicitly told not to use media, we included 
all of them in this work. 
The three researchers that coded this work often discussed 
coping  mechanism  used  to  ameliorate  the  impacts  that 
immersing  oneself  into  this  type  of  data  can  have  on  an 
individual. While it is standard procedure for researchers in 
our field to protect the subjects within a research endeavor, 
it is far more rare to take into consideration the impact on 
the  researcher(s)  [33].  More  discussions  need  to  be  had 
within our community as to what best practices and lessons 
learned  could  be  shared  by  other  disciplines  that  grapple 
with  immersion  into  research  areas  that  can  negatively 
impact the researcher conducting the study.

Eating  disorders  are  not  a  new  phenomenon  and  will 
continue  to  persist  within  the  interconnected  design  of 
current  popular  social  interactions.  As  social  computing 
researchers, we will play an increasingly important role in 
understanding how the platforms and technologies that we 
create  are  used  and  misappropriated  for  negative  health 
purposes.  While  it  is  not  our  role  to  design  health 
interventions and treatment protocols, we can form new and 
stronger  alliances  with  our  peers  in  the  mental  and 
behavioral  health  fields  to  share  insights  that  can  help 
inform  improved  and  more  targeted  interventions  and 
treatments.  
Through this analysis, we have analyzed the online, socially 
constructed presentations of eating disorders across several 
social  media  platforms.  We  found  that  irrespective  of 
platform,  there  are  salient  trends  within  these  support 
networks.  We  have  distilled 
the 
communication patterns within the networks and created a 
platform-independent  corpus  of  eating  disorder  related 
terminology. We have also highlighted remaining and new 
research  questions  with  regards  to  the  activities  of  this 
community,  and  the  potential  generalizability  of  this 
approach and the network trends to other behavioral health 
domains.
