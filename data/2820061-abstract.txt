In recent years, gamiﬁcation, “the use of game design ements in non-game contexts”, has drawn the attention of an increasing number of scientists. Although several studies highlighted the beneﬁts of gamiﬁcation in many applications, its potential in the enterprise environment still needs to be fully understood. This work contributes to the studies in enterprise gamiﬁcation with an experiment performed at a large multinational coany. The experiment involved 206 employees for a period of 2 months. We describe a modular and extensible framework for enterprise gamiﬁcation, designed to seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise-class Web systems. We studied how a gamiﬁed tool can help to foster employees’ engagement with such systems, by making day-to-day tasks more stimulating. We show how different game mechanics can help to achieve two business needs, namely social interaction and learning. To this end, we exploited the gamiﬁcation framework to delop a Q&A Web application combined with learning, news sharing, and social connections capabilities. Results pride strong evidence of how a gamiﬁed experience can foster learning and social behaviour in employees, and provide new insights about the effectiveness of several game mechanics in an enterprise context.
