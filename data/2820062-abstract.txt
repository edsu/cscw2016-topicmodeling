Speakers often come to use similar words during conversion; that is, they come to exhibit lexical similarity. The eent to which this occurs is associated with many positive sial outcomes. However, existing measures of lexical simarity are either highly labor intensive or too coarse in their temporal resolution. This limits the ability of researchers to study lexical similarity as it unfolds over the course of a coersation. We present a fully automated metric for tracking lexical similarity over time, and demonstrate it on individual conversations, explore general trends in aggregate conversional dynamics, and examine differences in how similarity tracks over time in groups with differing social outcomes.
