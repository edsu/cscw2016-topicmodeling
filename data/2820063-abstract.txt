Technology-supported citizen science has created huge vomes of data with increasing potential to facilitate scieiﬁc progress, however, verifying data quality is still a sutantial hurdle due to the limitations of existing data quaty mechanisms. In this study, we adopted a mixed metds approach to investigate community-based data validation practices and the characteristics of records of wildlife species observations that affected the outcomes of collaborative data quality management in an online community where people record what they see in the nature. The ﬁndings describe the processes that both relied upon and added to informion provenance through information stewardship behaviors, which led to improved reliability and informativity. The likihood of community-based validation interactions were pricted by several factors, including the types of organisms observed and whether the data were submitted from a mobile device. We conclude with implications for technology design, citizen science practices, and research.
