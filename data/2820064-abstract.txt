Baseline trust, which refers to the personality aspect of trust and varies with different individuals, is essential for undetanding the development of trust and cooperation in a team. At the same time, informal, non-work-related conversations (aka, cheap talk) have positive inﬂuences on the diffusion of trust and cooperation in global software engineering (GSE) practice. This paper seeks to develop an understanding of the inﬂuences of individuals’ baseline trust on the diffusion of trust and cooperation, in the presence of cheap talk over the Internet. We employ a novel approach, designing a viual experiment that integrates abstract agent-based modeling and simulation with realistic, empirical network structures and baseline trust data from two large open source projects (Apache LUCENE and Google CHROMIUM OS). The results highlight the signiﬁcant impact of baseline trust on the diffion of trust and cooperation, for instance, the emergence of non-traditional diffusion trajectories. The results also demotrate that proper seeding strategies can improve the effectivess and efﬁciency of diffusion of trust and cooperation.
