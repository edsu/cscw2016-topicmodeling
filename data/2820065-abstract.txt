Fashion is a multi-billion dollar industry with social and ecomic implications worldwide. To gain popularity, brands want to be represented by the top popular models. As new faces are selected using stringent (and often criticized) aehetic criteria, a priori predictions are made difﬁcult by infoation cascades and other fundamental trend-setting mechisms. However, the increasing usage of social media within and without the industry may be affecting this traditional syem. We therefore seek to understand the ingredients of suess of fashion models in the age of Instagram. Combing data from a comprehensive online fashion database and the popular mobile image-sharing platform, we apply a mhine learning framework to predict the tenure of a cohort of new faces for the 2015 Spring / Summer season throughout the subsequent 2015-16 Fall / Winter season. Our framework successfully predicts most of the new popular models who appeared in 2015. In particular, we ﬁnd that a strong social media presence may be more important than being under coract with a top agency, or than the aesthetic standards sought after by the industry.
