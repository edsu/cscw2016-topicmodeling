Despite the growing promotion of the “open data" movement, the collection, cleaning, management, interpretation, and diemination of open data is laborious and cost intensive, partilarly for non-proﬁts with limited resources. In this paper, we describe how non-proﬁt organizations (NPOs) use open data, building on prior literature that focuses on understanding chaenges that NPOs face. Based on 15 interviews of staff from 10 NPOs, our results suggest that NPOs use data to develop narratives to build a case for support from grantors and other stakeholders. We then present empirical results based on the usage of a data portal we created, which suggests that tecologies should be designed to not only make data accessible, but also to facilitate communication and support relationships between expert data analysts and NPOs.
