Technology is changing the way in which scientists and matmaticians communicate. New platforms for scholarly counication enhance informal communication and imbue it with some of the functionalities of formal communication. A citation analysis was conducted to examine how content from one of these platforms, MathOverﬂow, has been cited and referenced within the mathematics literature. Citation patterns suggested that some authors were treating Matverﬂow content as a legitimate source of scholarly knowdge. Some problems with references and attribution ourred, which can be addressed by changes in the design of these technologies. Developing better systems for scholarly communication can help advance open science.
