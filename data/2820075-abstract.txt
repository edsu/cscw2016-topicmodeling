Often, attention to “community” focuses on motivating core members or helping newcomers become regulars. However, much of the trafﬁc to online communities comes from pele who visit only brieﬂy. We hypothesize that their personal characteristics, design elements of the site, and others’ actity all affect the contributions these “one-timers” make. We present the results from an experiment asking Amazon Mhanical Turk (“AMT”) workers to comment on the AMT paicipation agreement in a discussion forum. One-timers with stronger ties to other Turkers or feelings of trust for Amazon are more likely to leave more — but shorter and less relant — comments, while those with higher self-efﬁcacy leave longer and more relevant comments. The phrasing of prompts also matters; a general appeal for personally-reﬂective contrutions leads to comments that are less relevant to community discussion topics. Finally, activity matters too; synchronous activity begets responses, while pre-existing content tends to suppress them. These ﬁndings suggest design moves that can help communities harness this “long tail” of contribution.
