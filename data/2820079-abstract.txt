When health services involve long-term treatment over months or years, providers have the ability, not present in acute emergency care, to collaboratively reflect on clientsâ€™ changing health data and adjust interventions. In this paper, we discuss temporality as a factor in the design of health information technology. We define a temporal spectrum ranging from that benefit from standardization to long-term services that require more flexibility. We provide empirical evidence from fieldwork that we performed in organizations providing long-term behavioral and mental health services for children. Our fieldwork this context complements and provides contrasts to previous CSCW studies performed in timritical hospital settings. Current literature shows a bias toward the implementation of health information technology, a policy that may not be appropriate for long-term health services. We discuss how the design of information systems should vary based on temporal factors.
