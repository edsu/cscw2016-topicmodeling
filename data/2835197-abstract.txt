Research on newcomer roles in peer production sites (e.g., Wikipedia) is characterized by a broad and relatively welrticulated set of functionally and culturally recognizable roles. But not all communities come with well-deﬁned roles that newcomers can aspire to occupy. The present study elores activity clusters newcomers create when faced with few recognizable roles to ﬁll and limited access to other paicipants’ work that serves as an exemplar. Drawing on a mixed method research design, we present ﬁndings from an analysis of 1,687 newcomers’ sessions in an online citizen science project. Our analysis revealed three major ﬁndings: (1) newcomers’ activities exists across six session types; (2) newcomers toggle between light work sessions and more iolved types of production or community engagement; (3) high-level contributors contribute large volumes of work but comment very little and another group contributes large vomes of comments, but works very little. The former group draws heavily on posts contributed by the latter group. Ideifying shifts and regularities in contribution facilitate iroved mechanisms for engaging participants and for the dign of online citizen science communities.
