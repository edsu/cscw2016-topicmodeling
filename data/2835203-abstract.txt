Eye contact is crucial to shared encounters in public spaces. However, most urban technologies that aim to foster social interaction tend to rely on screens, directing a significant proportion of the usersâ€™ attention towards the device rather than to those with whom the encounter is shared. We prent the design and evaluation of the Jokebox, a lightweight technology that requires two passers-by to coordinate aions to hear a joke. In three in the wild studies at different locations we found that our design supported micro-level coordination in a consistent manner: by encouraging people to make eye contact and by using audible jokes, users eaged in interactions that often led to further conversation and laughter. We describe how opportunities for macrevel coordination were key to the success of the installion, but varied by context. Finally, we present design ilications for considering both the micro and macro levels of social coordination.
